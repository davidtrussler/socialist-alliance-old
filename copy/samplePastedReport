Heemskerk</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> (SP) reported that the TUSC Steering Committee had met twice since the previous LULC Meeting.<span style=""> </span>Thirty eight candidates had now been endorsed, including eight from Scotland, and six more were pending.<span style=""> </span>The candidates included 4 UNISON Branch Secretaries; 5 UNISON Branch Officers; 2 RMT and 1 ASLEF Branch Officer; I UNITE Convenor and 4 former Labour councilors/Prospective Parliamentary Candidates.<span style=""> </span>Parties represented included the SP, SWP, SR, Lanarkshire SA and Solidarity.<span style=""> </span>Two candidates had been rejected.<span style=""> </span>One was because the local RMT branch had not been sure whether to endorse, but the individual subsequently appealed to the Branch which then agreed to approve, and the Steering Committee also agreed to endorse.<span style=""> </span>The other had wanted to stand against a RMT sponsored Labour MP, and this would not be acceptable to the RMT members of the Steering Committee.<span style=""> </span>He explained every member of the Steering Committee had the right of veto, and went on to outline how the RMT were now coming on board with Branches applying to the RMT Executive, and 13 RMT Branches have now backed TUSC.<span style=""> </span>This has encouraged political debate within the RMT between Labour and TUSC.<span style=""> </span>He concluded by explaining that he felt the project was a modest step forward, especially by raising the arguments about the need for working class political representation, and this despite leading trade union figures only being involved in an individual capacity – but each one is part of, and a leader of, a mass working class organization.<span style=""> </span>In answer to a question from <i>Toby Abse</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, he confirmed London Underground RMT had backed Jill Mountford (AWL) in Peckham.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The following general points were made in the discussion</span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="square"> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The veto allowed on the Steering Committee is undemocratic – there should be majority voting</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The veto reflects the fact this is a Coalition, not a Party</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The AWL has not applied for TUSC endorsement of its candidate</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The Coalition is bound to throw up problems and issues</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Labour right wingers should be opposed even if sponsored by a Trade Union</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The RMT veto is wrong, and the Steering Committee should address its lack of democracy</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">TUSC should be inclusive and allow Supporting Organisations onto the Steering Committee as was originally envisaged</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">With TUSC unlikely to contest more than 50 seats out of 650, we should not be concerned at whether or not we oppose trade union sponsored candidates at this stage.<span style=""> </span>Building TUSC for developments after the General election is more important</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">TUSC is an interaction between the trade union and socialist movement led by the SP</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Our aims for the General election should be ambitious but achievable, establishing the left as a champion of democracy and working class political representation and into one united organization which was part of the labour movement.<span style=""> </span>TUSC is the only vehicle for such a project.</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Those not supporting TUSC have fallen away from the LULC</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">We need to build on the ground for what will be needed after the Election which will be savage cuts, anti trade union initiatives and attacks on civil liberties</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The lack of democracy within TUSC will make it difficult for TUSC to champion democracy</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Giving trade union bureaucrats a blank cheque is a dangerous road to go down</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Defence of trade unions is the key issue. <span style=""> </span>We should ask all candidates where they stand on the anti trade union laws</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">It was disappointing that left organizations like CPGB had not received candidate endorsement</span></li> <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">We need as many TUSC candidates as possible</span></li> </ul> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">In addition, specific points were raised, as follows:</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><i>Steve Freeman</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> (RDG) wanted a TUSC branch and candidate in Peckham, Southwark.<span style=""> </span>He argued there were not enough resources in Sothwark to stand in more than one seat.<span style=""> </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><i>Toby Abse</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> (SA) pointed out that the AWL’s Jill Mountford was already standing in Peckham and that Southwark had two other constituencies.<span style=""> </span>He also hoped London would have more than 4 TUSC candidates, and he asked that we promote the ‘Defend the Welfare State’ demonstration on April 10.<span style=""> </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><i>Peter Manson</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> (CPGB) wanted to know why their 3 candidates had not been endorsed.<span style=""> </span>They had wanted to be open and avoid clashes.<span style=""> </span>The CPGB had opposed No2EU because it did not include demands for open borders or republican democracy, including the right to bear arms, but these were not conditions for the General Election</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">In his reply, <i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> explained that the SP was concentrating on Lewisham and thus not Southwark.<span style=""> </span>He suggested Steve Freeman do the groundwork for a TUSC candidate in Southwark.<span style=""> </span>He accepted the slowness of the process had been frustrating.<span style=""> </span>Time constraints had prevented detailed discussions at Steering Committee meetings.<span style=""> </span>However, a Coalition had been formed for a limited purpose which enabled RMT branches and socialist organizations to put forward candidates.<span style=""> </span>TUSC candidates had to be accountable to TUSC.<span style=""> </span>In the CPGB’s case, they had not specified which seats and candidates they wanted to be endorsed, simply asking for three unnamed candidates to be endorsed.<span style=""> </span>In the European elections, the CPGB’s decision to support Labour and not No2EU was based on the refusal by Lead No 2EU candidates to commit to supporting a workers’ militia – this did not help their cause.<span style=""> </span>Also, the CPGB had not answered the questions around ‘social weight’.<span style=""> </span>Regarding Liverpool, which had been raised by the tUSP delegate to the meeting, Pete Glover had stood before and was the SP’s nominated candidate.<span style=""> </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">There was further discussion.<span style=""> </span><i>Pete McLaren</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> could see why TUSC had concerns about an organization who felt it crucial in any election that a Coalition supported workers’ militia, but on the other hand he had hoped TUSC would have been more open and inclusive.<span style=""> </span>The CPGB needs to be more serious about where it intends to stand, and he hoped the SP could move on from No2EU and those who had opposed it.<span style=""> </span>It was crucial that we build on both No2EU and TUSC immediately after the General Election, and that we do so in an inclusive and non sectarian way.<span style=""> </span><i>Terry Pearce </i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">(CNWP) agreed TUSC was a step forward and argued we should all work to make TUSC more effective.<span style=""> </span>We should relate to all anti cuts initiatives.<span style=""> </span><i>Peter Manson</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> asked that if the CPGB came back with specific constituencies, would that then be considered by the TUSC Steering Committee, or would lack of social weight be more important?</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"> replied to the discussion.<span style=""> </span>He outlined how there had been more discussion within the RMT than had been the case with No2EU.<span style=""> </span>He reminded organizations TUSC was a temporary coalition, not a perfectly formed party.<span style=""> </span>He re-iterated his concerns that the CPGB had not answered the social weight questions, and suggested they obtain RMT branch support for constituencies they wished to contest before coming back to the Steering Committee.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span
