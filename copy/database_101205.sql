That was an achievement in itself. He added that it was essential that something tangible came out of the meeting to take us forward towards the long term goal of a new left party.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>INITIAL DISCUSSION</h3>\r\n<p>After everyone had introduced themselves, <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> (SA) took the chair, and began by asking that those who had submitted Papers speak briefly to them. There then followed a wide ranging discussion where each group present explained where they were at in terms of the need for left unity, what the barriers to unity might be, and how they thought we might be able to work together more effectively. There was general agreement about the need for working class political representation now that Labour was finished, and that a new left / green-left party therefore needed to be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PROPOSALS FOR ACTION</h3>\r\n<p>After a short break, the following proposals were put forward:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intervene at the Manchester Convention of the Left</li>\r\n<li>Produce a Joint Statement in support of the public sector strikes</li>\r\n<li>All organisations (except LRC and GL) agree to avoid electoral clashes</li>\r\n<li>Ask the LRC and the GL to consider whether there might be some way they could contribute to a clash avoidance agreement</li>\r\n<li>An accounting function - each organisation to submit a brief statement about where it stood on working with others, and on the question of a united left party - and what problems or issues it could foresee. A draft would be produced from contributions which would be circulated.</li>\r\n<li>We form a Left liaison Committee to have dialogue on the process as it unfolds</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Groups commented on these proposals.</p>\r\n<p>THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE AGREED:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Produce a Joint Statement in support of the public sector strikes - <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> (SA) to initiate and circulate</li>\r\n<li>Each organisation to discuss internally, in the light of this meeting, its position on cooperation and unity with other groups, including what barriers there might be.

We saw the\r\nConvention of the Left as a continuation of this process, providing\r\nfurther possibilities to build the trust needed in order for comrades\r\nfrom different socialist backgrounds and traditions to work together,\r\nand we encouraged our members, supporters and affiliates to attend.</p><p></p><p>In the eighteen months since these developments, much further progress has been made. Fifteen socialist and green socialist organisations have now agreed to further regular liaison, and have together formed a Left Unity Liaison Committee (LULC) which has now met eight times in 18 months. We have also seen two left Coalitions formed for Electoral projects. In 2009, No2EU-YestoDemocracy contested the European elections in every region, supported by the RMT, SP, ISG, CPB, IWA and ourselves. SA National Secretary Pete McLaren was a candidate in the West Midlands where Dave Nellist headed the list. One of the aims was to provide an alternative protest vote for working class people who, in desperation but not necessarily racism, are turning towards the BNP. No2EU has now developed into the trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) for the general Election, again with the support of the SA. We see these developments, despite some limitations, as being further steps down the path towards a new socialist party, our main goal.</p>\r\n\r\n'),(5,'Report on the Convention of the Left, Manchester, Sept 20Â â€“Â 24 2008',1,2,'<h1>CONVENTION OF THE LEFT MANCHESTER SEPT 20 - 24</h1> \r\n<h2>REPORT COMPILED BY PETE McLAREN, National Secretary, Socialist Alliance</h2> \r\n\r\n<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have drawn up this report from my own participation in a number of Sundayâ€™s sessions, including the concluding session entitled â€˜Unity in Actionâ€™, and â€˜Question Time for the Leftâ€™ on Wednesday. Reports on other sessions have been taken from comments from those who were there, and, when specified, the Convention Organisation Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SA agreed to sponsor the CoL because it saw the Convention of the Left as having the potential to continue the process of re-uniting the left which began at the CNWP Open Forum before its Conference in June when leading members of Respect, the LRC and the CNWP, along with trade union leaders, called for the building of a new left party. Â This process had moved forward with the Left Unity meeting initiated by the SA on July 5 when 12 different socialist unity projects and left green/left organisations, including all the main players, met together and decided to look at their own positions on cooperation and unity with other groups, and to discuss forming a left liaison committee at the follow up meeting called for October 11th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, concerns were expressed beforehand as to whether the Convention would actually further cement what had been developing over the summer, or whether it would not really commit anyone to building the socialist alternative. Â The Statement of Intent, which was circulated before the Convention, in concrete terms only called for the setting up of left forums without defining how these would be organised or what their purpose would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A NUMBER OF POSITIVES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event, a number of positives came out of the Convention. Thousands attended the Stop the War demonstration on the Saturday, which marched past the Labour Party conference, calling for troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Holding the Convention of the Left at the same time as the Labour Party Conference gave opportunities for media coverage and provided a real contrast with the stage-managed undemocratic forum down the road. It also encouraged Labour left conference delegates and MPs to participate with the left outside Labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Convention was genuinely open, democratic and most sessions were fully participatory. Many sessions apparently virtually did away with platform speakers. and instead were virtually handed over to the audience, thus encouraging a free exchange of views between the invited speakers and the meeting itself. On the sessions I attended, including Question Time for the Left on Wednesday evening, there were about 150 people present, although others report some 300 at times over the weekend.</p> \r\n \r\n<h3>WEEKEND SESSIONS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening session of the Convention was entitled â€˜What unites us?â€™ with a panel of John McDonnell MP, Tony Benn, Lyndsey German (SWP) and Derek Wall (Green Left). At the next session on Saturday, â€˜The Break up of the UKâ€™? the Organising Committee felt it became clear that the left, particularly in England, had not even begun to address the question of what to do when and if Scotland and Wales vote for independence, and how socialists in all these countries should work together. This was followed by â€˜Campaigning against Immigration Controlsâ€™ where the Campaign against Immigration Controls teamed up with Manchester No Borders to demonstrate the ways in which they wanted to work together to prevent people seeking asylum from destitution, to close down detention centres and to stop deportations. There was also a session entitled â€˜How do we stop the Database State?â€™</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunday began with a session on Working for Left unity, led by Tariq Ali and John Nicholson. This was followed by â€˜Fighting for Equalityâ€™ with Maria Exall (LRC), Katy Clark MP, Linda Riordan MP, Amrit Wilson and Margaret Boyle. The Organising Committee report the session contained substantial contributions to argue for womenâ€™s reproductive rights, and womensâ€™ rights at work. The discussion also involved the National Assembly of Women, Feminist Fightback and the Abortion Rights campaign Other reports say it was a meeting run by women and overwhelmingly dominated by women speakers. A Womenâ€™s Charter was proposed, calling for societal, workplace and labour movement rights for women. The Charter already had the support of 15 trade unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was followed by a session entitled â€˜Where now for the Unions?â€™ led by academic Gregor Hall, Mark Serwotka (PCS), Matt wrack (FBU, Pat Sikorski (RMT), Jane Lofus (U) and Carolyn Jones (Institute of Employment Rights). There was a call for joint union activity against the pay freeze and in defense of jobs and working conditions. Included was a discussion about usefulness or other wise of the trade union link, how disaffiliation affected unions like the MT and FBU, and the possibilities or impossibilities of changing the Labour Party. There was also a discussion about the problems of getting a new party, on how to rebuild trade unions strength, and where the priorities of struggle should be in the next period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WHERE NOW FOR THE LEFT?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final session on Sunday, entitled â€˜Where now for the Left?â€™, the view generally expressed was that the Labour Party was no longer worth supporting, but it was not worth alienating those on the left inside the Labour Party by suggesting the creation of a new left party. The pre-circulated Statement of Intent was agreed in principle with none against. This called for an alternative to New Labourâ€™s war mongering neo liberal agenda by joining together with all those seeking a better society - as an anti-capitalist left fighting for an alternative socialist society. The statement concluded that this does not mean the construction of another political party - but ways to co-ordinate action, strengthen the development of existing campaigns and encourage the devevelopment of local left forums to promote discussion and coordinate united action across the left in an inclusive, participatory, pluralist, tolerant and democratic way. It was also agreed to hold a â€œrecall eventâ€ on Nov 29 to seek agreement on what emerges from the Convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WEEKDAY SESSIONS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Monday, the Convention had sessions on the Dangers of Globilisation; The Economic Crisis; Stopping Brownâ€™s nuclear madness; Anti fascist strategy for Manchester; Climate Change and Repeal the anti trade union laws. Aaccording to the Organising Committee, there were 350 people present. It was agreed at those first two sessions that you can not talk about the economy without talking about the environment and vica versa. There was an LRC Rally where Tony Benn called for left unity to combat the rise of the far right.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>On Tuesday, there were sessions on People and Public Services, Housing, Transport, Education and Health. At the opening session according to the Organising Committee, Jeremy Corbyn called for a fight against privatisation across the world. In other sessions, there were also calls for free public transport; the building of alliances with workers, tenants and home owners; opposition to privatisation of education, especially the divisive plans for city academies; opposition to privatisation of health. At the end, there was a call for uniting the campaigns against privatisation and in favour of fully democratic, participatory structures.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Wednesdayâ€™s theme on Peace included sessions on â€˜Africaâ€™s Forgotten Warsâ€™; Hamas; Iraq; Pakistan and Iran. These will be reported on later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>QUESTION TIME FOR THE LEFT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The convention ended on Wednesday evening with â€˜Question Time for the Leftâ€™. This was billed as â€œaiming to bring together key figures from the left to debate the key issues raised during the conventionâ€. It was also stated that panel members were asked to keep their answers short so there would be plenty of time for answers from the floor. This was only partially successful. The panel had eight members - Rob Griffiths (CPB); Derek Wall (Green Left); John McDonnell MP (LRC); Mark Serwotka (PCS); Hilary Wainwright (Red Pepper); Clive Searle (Respect); Colin Fox (SSP) and Lindsey German (SWP). John Nicholson was in the chair. The CNWP had, belatedly, asked for Dave Nellist to be on this or similar platforms, to no avail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With eight panel members, all of whom spoke at the beginning, and most of whom had a further two minutes minimum on each of the eight questions asked, there was not much time left for members of the audience, and most of those called seem to be known by the Chair although, to be fair, that may have been a coincidence. Many of these contributions from the floor were anecdotal, and were more about what that individual had done than anything else. <span class=\"em\">More to the point, the overwhelming number of questions taken came from someone on behalf of a particular Convention Session or Group</span>, such as the economy or women. These questions had been received in advance. The rest of us were told on arrival that we could each submit a question, but it was unlikely to be called because a maximum of three (out of over twenty individually submitted) would be randomly chosen. I had prepared a question on the party question, as I correctly suspected this would be avoided otherwise. I was told 10 minutes before the start I had to write it out again on official Convention notepaper! My question asked the panel to accept that Labour was finished, and that therefore agree there was a need to unite the left as part of the process of building a new mass socialist party. It was not taken, along with most others from the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first question asked what each panel member thought of the Convention so far. Interestingly, this brought out some of the most useful responses of the Session. Colin Fox (SSP) hoped the Convention would be a move towards a more united left. Hilary Wainwright added that the Convention had shown there was an alternative to New Labour and that trust within the left was being rebuilt. Rob Griffiths (CPB) complained about the fragmentation of the left, and called for more discussions and more united campaigning. <span class=\"em\">He also announced that Morning Star had opened up its coverage to the rest of the left.</span> Mark Serwotka argued that we needed something politically better than Labour - we need to work together and build an alternative he suggested. John McDonnell felt the Convention had been a positive experience, with much consensus and high quality debates - <span class=\"em\">but it must not just be a talking shop and action must follow. He suggested a network be set up and for there to be a campaign against energy price rises. He accepted that the debate between the Campaign for a New Workersâ€™ Party and those who wanted to remain in the Labour Party had not been resolved, but said that was an on-going discussion.</span> He suggested the Convention become an annual event to coincide with the Labour Party Conference. Clive Searle felt the Convention had been successful and enjoyable, and he was pleased to have had the opportunity to talk with the left of the Labour Party. Derek Wall noted the blocks on building an alternative, such as an absence of PR and and the difficulty of breaking trade union links with the Labour Party. <span class=\"em\">He felt the stress on tolerance and the need for a pluralistic approach had been important legacies of the Convention.</span> Lyndsey German (SWP) argued the left must work together to respond to the present capitalist crisis and likely increase in warfare, and it should not â€˜beat itself upâ€™ about the past. The left had continued to work together to fight the BNP, and it had worked together in the Stop the War movement, she concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main concrete campaigning idea to come out of Question Time was a general agreement <span class=\"em\">to organise a campaign this autumn and winter against fuel poverty - specifically for a windfall tax on energy companies; for the industry to be taken back into public ownership; and for direct action to prevent disconnections. There could also be a coordinated refusal to pay for increased bills under the slogan â€œCanâ€™t Pay, Wonâ€™t Payâ€.</span></p> \r\n\r\n<p>These ideas were supported by Mark Serwotka, who informed the meeting that PCS was already in agreement with a campaign for a windfall tax, and argued that all utilities should be in public ownership; by Rob Griffiths who called for a joint mass campaign; by John McDonnell who added that nationalisation must unite energy workers and consumers; by Clive Serle who argued for a mass campaign of disobedience against disconnections; by Derek Wall who argued for workers control and economics â€˜beyond capitalismâ€™; by Lindsey German who suggested the demand for a windfall tax should initiate the campaign; and by the rest of the panel in general terms and by three members of the audience who spoke on the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"em\">This was all good positive stuff, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating - will such a campaign actually be organised?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were several other questions asked from Convention sessions. To the second one, on why left organisations were so pale and male, there was a general panel consensus that the left needed to do more to organise in a way that makes its meetings and activities more accessible to women and black communities, and should make more effort to look outwards and to work with minority groups. In answer to a question on attitudes towards the wars Britain was promoting, which Labour would not discuss, the Panel talked about the million deaths and 4 million refuges in Iraq; the massive hatred of Britain across the world for its war and occupation policies; the shame the wars have brought on the country; the ability of the establishment to ignore or misunderstand public opinion; the continuing danger of an attack on Iran. On the positive side, the success of building a massive anti war movement was mentioned, a movement which remained strong largely thanks to the leftâ€™s involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A question on the need for a free, nationalised and public ally integrated public transport system, brought to the fore by climate change, was heartily supported by one and all, and it was suggested that there was a real basis for a campaign on free transport, with, as John McDonnell pointed out, the three rail unions now supporting an integrated public transport system based on public ownership. John McDonnell also suggested the left engages with the climate change movt, and joins campaigns against the 3rd runway at Heathrow.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>A question was taken from the audience as to whether the Panel would support direct action against ID cards. Only two panel members responded: Lyndsey German spoke of the increased attacks on civil liberties, and Rob Griffiths felt direct action was justified - we should refuse to have an ID card. This was followed by a â€˜groupâ€™ question on <span class=\"em\">how do we as socialists justify workers implementing immigration controls.</span> Mark Serwotka explained that the PCS represented many such workers, but the PCS as a union supported all campaigns against deportations and immigration controls. The union also campaigned to change the laws on such issues, but it was important for workers in these areas to be unionised, as had been the case at GCHQ despite its role for the state.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The final question before I had to leave after nearly two hours was on the Statement of Intent - what would panel members do to encourage the development of left forums? John McDonnell described how one was already being set up in his constituency, and the LRC would discuss the possibilities at its AGM in November. Clive Serale felt forums could come out of the fuel campaign. Derek Wall felt we should use the Morning Star which was opening up to others. Lyndsey German suggested we relate to all local campaigns, and forums must be based on activists and not be talking shops. At this stage, a member of the Labour Party, speaking from the audience, argued passionately that we needed a strategy for building a new party to the left of Labour!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Convention was, in some ways, a continuation of the process we are all involved in to re-unite the left and build a new mass socialist party. Some interesting suggestions and plans came out of it. It should be supported for that. Whether anything more long term comes out of it remains to be seen - we have to convince the rest of the left, including those at the Convention, that we need to build a new Workersâ€™ Party now, not at some undefined date in the future.</p>'),(54,'Left Unity Liaison Committee Jan 31 2009',7,2,'<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica-Bold, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica,

circulated and\r\ndiscussed.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>There was general\r\ndisappointment that the left TU leaders were playing a waiting game and not\r\nbuilding a new party to give the working class political representation.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>It was also thought that, although\r\nthere was a possibility that the unity through action perspective from the\r\nConvention of the Left could, in the long term, help in the process of building\r\nsomething new on the left, the Convention was unlikely to achieve much in the\r\nshort term.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>It represented low\r\nlevel left co-operation at best, and most organisations felt little of\r\nsubstance had so far emanated from it.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"

General Secretary Robert Griffiths, one of the\r\nforty individuals drawing it up, introduced the Charter.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>He outlined the history behind it.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The CPB had called for alternative\r\npolicies to be drawn together in July, and in September leaders of the RMT, POA\r\nand FBU sent out invitations to meet and discuss the way forward for the left.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The Peoples Charter developed from\r\nthat.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The aim was to get one\r\nmillion

general\r\ndiscussion, many felt that the Peoples Charter was a step forward in that its\r\nproposals were broadly supportable, and it had significant left trade union\r\nsupport.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>However, it failed to\r\naddress the question of government.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>How would the political demands it was making be implemented?<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>How could the Charter help change society?<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Organisations also wondered how it\r\ncould be amended.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>There was some\r\nsupport for a suggestion that the left generally backs the Charter whilst\r\ncalling for it to also address the crisis in working class political\r\nrepresentation.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Others were not so\r\nsure. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"

Socialist',5,2,'<h1>The need to build a new left alternative &#8211; Now!</h1>\n\n<h3>Pete McLaren, national secretary of the Socialist Alliance and press officer of the Campaign for a New Workers Party (CNWP), has written this contribution to <span class=\"name\">The Socialist</span> in response to the article by general secretary of the PCS trade union, Mark Serwotka, in issue 519. Below Pete&#8217;s contribution is a response from Socialist Party councillor Dave Nellist, the national CNWP chair person.</h3>\n\n<p>Mark Serwotka raised the vitally important question for all socialists in his interesting article headed &#8216;How can an alternative to the main parties be developed?&#8217;. He ably explained why we need it. New Labour must now be seen as a Tory party, nothing less. So Mark comes to the conclusion that many of us made some time ago &#8211; we need a new left party.</p>\n\n<p>What impresses me is that Mark clearly sees that industrial struggle alone will not be enough, important as trade union support for a new initiative will be. I also think his call to campaign for proportional representation is crucial for the left to make best use of electoral opportunities, not that electoralism would be the be-all and end-all. Equally significant is his call for left unity, with his assertion: &#8220;Our loyalty must be to our class, not our party card&#8221;. As Mark concluded, what unites us is far greater than what divides us. The old 80/20.</p>\n\n<p>I believe strongly that we should be building a new mass socialist organisation/party &#8211; and quickly. There may not yet be an upturn in working class political activity, but workers are increasingly realising that there is no real difference between the policies of the three main parties. They want an alternative in the here and now. If not, some will turn to the racist and fascist BNP, as has already begun.</p>\n\n<h4>Working to a timetable</h4>\n\n<p>The discussion on how to build that alternative must start now. We need a timetable. It should be in no more than two years &#8211; or by the next general election. That would force us to focus. At the moment the CNWP is a <span class=\"em\">campaign</span> for a new party. I am proud to be the CNWP press officer, and the Socialist Alliance, of which I am national secretary, has played a positive role in the CNWP&#8217;s development. But, after two years, it remains very much a campaign, albeit the most likely one to succeed. </p>\n\n<p>A campaign is pursued to achieve a purpose. What is the CNWP&#8217;s purpose? It is to form a new workers&#8217; party. After two years of pursuing that goal, we need to take stock. How close are we to it? If we do not intend to have that new party in place by the next general election, for example, then what is our goal? If it is the same goal we set ourselves in March 2006, then why have our actions not been effective?</p>\n\n<h4>Moving CNWP forward</h4>\n\n<p>The Socialist Alliance has put forward a number of suggestions which could have moved the CNWP towards at least a pre-party formation or a pro-party alliance. We have suggested that the 3,000 CNWP supporters are encouraged to become individual members of the campaign. We called on the CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and automatic representation from all supportive political organisations irrespective of size, and representation for independents. We asked for CNWP working groups to develop the agreed policy points in the CNWP Charter. We suggested a discussion e-list to encourage dialogue between supporters. All of these, so far rejected by the Socialist Party majority, would keep the campaign going whilst starting to prepare for a more structured organisation &#8211; as agreed at the CNWP launch conference.</p>\n\n<p>We need a party/organisation that is open, inclusive of both individuals and socialist/green socialist groups, pluralistic, democratic and non-sectarian in every sense of the word. It should be formed both by campaigning amongst the working class, as the CNWP quite rightly is doing, but also by inviting all the left to join. Yes, that includes the Socialist Workers&#8217; Party (SWP).</p>\n\n<h4>Socialist unity</h4>\n\n<p>How you get that unity is not easy. The Socialist Alliance moved at the last CNWP steering committee for discussions to commence about how best to approach all socialist unity projects and other progressive red/green groups and individuals &#8211; with a view to inviting them to a conference in 2008 to <span class=\"strong\">discuss ways of uniting the left</span> &#8211; not to form the new party. That was also rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Some of us have been striving for socialist unity for over 15 years. Why has it not happened? We need to identify the hurdles. The main one is the sectarianism of the left. Each left group/unity project thinks it has the answers and seeks to build its own organisation first and foremost. We must learn tolerance and respect for each other, and acknowledge that none of us has all the answers. Those of us involved in the original SA, or, indeed, within Respect, will be only too aware of the SWP&#8217;s control freakery. We will need structures in place that prevent a repeat. But we need to include the SWP, just as we should welcome and include all progressive socialist and green socialist forces.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Serwotka was so right when he mentioned the idiocy of there being three different socialist unity projects meeting on the same Saturday in different venues. By the following weekend, a further four had met nationally but separately &#8211; Respect Renewal, the SA, TUSP and the AGS. This division of the left into at least seven distinct blocks has got to be overcome. As a start, whilst we continue to develop the CNWP, we should also organise a delegate conference to discuss, at the very least, ways of uniting the left, and explore how we could unite better. The SA will be pursuing this goal in the months ahead.</p>'),(7,'',0,3,'<h1>Campaign for a New Workers\' Party</h1>\r\n<p class=\"first\">The Campaign for a New Workers\' Party was launched in\r\nMarch 2006 and represents a major step forwards in the project to\r\nunite the British left within a single organisation.

At this stage the delegates at the conference felt it should take a federal approach to bring in as many supportive organisations and groups as possible, with no one group or individual dominating. </p>\r\n <p>Dave Nellist, elected as the chair of the new steering committee said after the conference: \'Today has been a very good start to our aim of preparing the way for a new party based on trade unionists, anti-war campaigners, community and environmental activists and particularly young people. </p>\r\n <p>\'With PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka speaking at the conference, along with other supportive messages from leading trade union figures, then this shows we have a strong base in the unions. A key objective now will be to get the unions to break from Labour and support our campaign.\'</p>\r\n <p>Over 300 of the delegates at the conference were active trade unionists, including many members of trade union national executive committees and leading representatives at all levels of the trade unions. The new Campaign has a structure that allows trade unions to affiliate it and over half of the new steering committee were elected by trade union commissions on the day.. </p>\r\n <p>Dave Nellist added: \'I think the timing of our launch has been just right. The sleaze allegations surrounding Labour, along with talk of state funding of the political parties which will further break the unions\' now tenuous links with Labour then I think we are well placed to see our campaign go from strength to strength. </p>\r\n <p>\'The Conference clearly concluded that Labour was no longer an option for working people. The CNWP needed to become the clear option for the working class, but it must first be rooted in communities and within the left, and that will be our task in the months ahead.\'</p>\r\n <p>Although this was an initial conference of the CNWP it agreed a number of immediate tasks aimed at popularising the idea of a new mass workers\' party amongst as wide a section of the working class as possible. </p>\r\n <p>This included: </p>\r\n <p>o Actively supporting any initiatives towards the development of a new party. In particular encouraging those trade union and trade union leaders that no longer believe that New Labour can represent their interests to take active steps towards founding a new party. </p>\r\n <p>o Reaffirming support for the declaration for a new workers\' party and aiming to have at least 5000 trade union, community and anti-war activists signed up by the end of 2006. </p>\r\n <p>o Establishing affiliation to the CNWP. Affiliation for national organisations will be Â£50 and for local community, trade union and campaigning organisations Â£25. All national affiliated organisations with 100 or more members would have a seat on the steering committee. </p>\r\n <p>o To get CNWP speakers to address local community, trade union and campaigning organisations meetings. </p>\r\n <p>o Organise a CNWP speaking tour in May which aims to develop local CNWP campaigns in those areas where they don\'t yet exist. </p>\r\n <p>o Organise CNWP fringe meetings at as many trade union conferences as possible. </p>\r\n <p>o To give support to genuine socialist and anti-cuts, anti-privatisation campaigns in the local elections. </p>\r\n <p>o The steering committee will call a second national conference, by the end of March 2007 at the latest, to assess the progress made and look at how to further take the campaign forward. </p>\r\n <p>The new officers of the campaign elected at the conference are:\r\n \r\n Secretary: Roger Bannister (member of UNISON national executive â€“ personal capacity) \r\n Chair: Dave Nellist (Socialist Party councillor, Coventry) \r\n Vice-Chair: Kevin Kelly (vice-president PCS national executive â€“ personal capacity)\r\n Vice-chair: Jeremy Dewar \r\n Press Officer: Pete McLaren \r\n Treasurer: Fiona Pashazadeh \r\n Trade union liaison officer: Glenn Kelly (UNISON national executive â€“ personal capacity) \r\n Assistant Secretary: Hannah Sell </p>\r\n <p>Images from the CNWP Conference.

He announced supportive apologies from the General Secretary of the Prison Officers Association, a NATFHE Exec and Labour Party member, Pat Sikourski (Deputy President RMT) and Matt Wrack, Gen Sec FBU.</p>\n  <p>The SP\'s Hannah Sell spelt out that there must be no false starts as happened with the SLP. It would take time to build support for the Campaign. We needed something bigger and better than Respect. We need to be open, democratic and welcoming. We need to enable groups to retain their own identity.</p>\n  <p>Roger Bannister moved the resolution on behalf of SP. He argued for trade union support, the aim to recruit 5,000 people by December, the need to keep policy debate to a minimum at this stage, the need to fight for a socialist programme, a structure that includes affiliation to the CNWP, meetings to promote the CNWP and a re-call Conference by March 2007. This resolution was overwhelmingly passed.</p>\n  <p>Pete McLaren moved the resolution from the Socialist Alliance which called for signatories to the Declaration to be grouped geographically to contact local activists to meet and elect local Interim Committees. It also asked the CNWP Committee to start considering the most suitable structure to encourage the left, unions, independents, tenants and community groups to work towards unity at their own pace. He argued that the SA included comrades with 14 years experience of working for socialist unity, which had included high points like the 98 SA candidates in the 2001 General Election, but included negative lessons including the domination of the SA by one group, the SWP. This resolution was (very) overwhelmingly passed.</p>\n  <p>Workers Power moved their resolution on steps towards a new mass, internationalist and socialist party. This was defeated, by a card vote, by 213 votes to 77. </p>\n  <p>Lee Rock from the CPGB moved their resolution on the CNWP becoming a campaign for a Marxist party. This was overwhelmingly defeated.</p>\n  <p>The Reading CNWP group moved a resolution for any new party to be open, inclusive, democratic and representative. It must appeal to anti war activists , those that campaign on environmental issues, pensions and against racism. It called for no single group to be allowed to dominate, and mechanisms to ensure democratic policy making. This was passed overwhelmingly.</p>\n  <p>Steve Freeman moved the RDG resolution to recognise that the struggle for a new workers party is a political and ideological struggle. It called for members to form platforms on the party question. This resolution was defeated. </p>\n  <p>Revolution moved a resolution on organising young people. This was overwhelmingly defeated.</p>\n  <p>John Pearson moved the DSA resolution to support a non federalist structure similar to that of the SSP, to campaign for a party based on the fundamentals of Marxism and that adopts PBP and is opposed to the bureaucratic centralism and sectarianism of many left groups. This resolution was heavily defeated.</p>\n  <p>The resolution from the International Socialist Resistance was remitted to the Committee</p>\n  <p>During the debate, many points were raised including:<br>\n    * We need our own party to transform society<br>\n    * We can link with workers and community campaigns<br>\n    * We need to develop the confidence of the working class, and its capacity to achieve socialism<br>\n    * We need a party to represent the deprived and oppressed<br>\n    * We need a new Party to oppose Labour\'s privatisation and to give TUs a voice<br>\n    * We need a Party for tenants and community activists<br>\n    * We must include environmentalism in our programme<br>\n    * We may need to make compromises to build a broad based party<br>\n    * Getting rid of capitalism is relevant : we need an honest debate, not to trick workers</p>\n  <p>Alan Thornett addressed the Conference on behalf of Respect. He explained that Respect would not be signing the Declaration for the CNWP, but he accepted discussions were needed between Respect and the CNWP. He argued Respect was part of the process to building a new movement, but not the answer. Respect was the best opportunity yet for a broad based pluralist party. The left should join Respect to build it <br>\n      <br>\n      Dave Nellist moved the resolution on the formation of the Steering Committee to meet quarterly, with 8 Officers and an Interim steering Committee with the Officers plus one rep for all political affiliates with over 100 members, with co-options from new forces, and observers from trade union leaders or representatives. This was agreed almost unanimously.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Officers were elected unanimously as follows:<br>\n      Secretary - Roger Bannister (SP)<br>\n      Chair - Dave Nellist (SP)<br>\n      Vice Chairs - Kevin Nally; Jeremy Dewar (Workers Power)<br>\n      Press Officer - Pete McLaren <br>\n      Treasurer - Fionna Pashazadeh (SP)<br>\n      TU Liaison - Glenn Kelly (SP)<br>\n      Ass Sec - Hannah Sell (SP)</p>\n  <p>Dave Nellist concluded the Conference by thanking everyone who had attended and helped to organise it.

Our premise is simple: that we urgently need to campaign for the establishment of a new party that represents the majority - working class people. The three mainstream parties, while there are differences between them, are all fundamentally the same in that they represent the interests of big business and put forward a programme of privatisation and cuts. </p>\n  <p>The millions who voted for New Labour in 1997 - hoping that things could \'only get better\' after 18 years of Tory government - have been cruelly disappointed. Under the Tories the gap between rich and poor had reached the highest level since records began. Under New Labour it has increased further. Since 1997, the wealth of the top 1% has doubled from &pound;355 billion to &pound;797 billion - more than the government spends in five years on education, the NHS and housing combined! At the same time, every year 200,000 babies - one third of all those born - are born into poverty.</p>\n  <p>The government\'s reliance on Tory votes to force through the Education Bill graphically demonstrates both the narrowness of the gap between the parties and the determination of the New Labour government to use its third term to step up its destruction of the public sector. </p>\n  <p>We believe that the chance to reclaim the Labour Party has long past and there is no point in continuing to fuel false hopes. The recent success of the new left party in Germany, winning 8.8% of the vote and 54 MPs, gives a glimpse of the potential for a new left force. We pledge to do all in our power to bring a new workers\' party into being in England and Wales. <br>\n    This is an initial conference of the CNWP. Our task from today is to popularise the idea of a new mass workers\' party amongst as wide a section of the working class as possible. </p>\n  <p>We therefore agree the following:</p>\n  <p>o We will actively support any initiatives towards the development of a new party. In particular we will encourage those trade union and trade union leaders that no longer believe that New Labour can represent their interests to take active steps towards founding a new party.</p>\n  <p>o We reaffirm our support for the declaration for a new workers\' party and will continue to use it as a means build impetus for the idea of a new party. We aim to have at least 5000 trade union, community and anti-war activist signed up by the end of 2006. We recognise that there are many important points not included in the declaration but we think it would be premature at this stage to start deciding what should, or should not, be added to the declaration. Instead it would be better to keep a minimal declaration and concentrate on building momentum for the campaign.</p>\n  <p>o However, it is important to emphasise that any future new party, if it is to be successful, must be something completely different to the existing neo-liberal order. As we state in the declaration a new party would need to represent a fundamental break with the big business parties which currently dominate politics, giving workers the opportunity to resist the neo-liberal capitalist agenda and fight for a socialist programme - including a living minimum wage, full trade union rights and for fully funded, democratically controlled public services.</p>\n  <p>o We agree to establish affiliation to the CNWP. Affiliation for national organisations will be &pound;50 and for local community, trade union and campaigning organisations &pound;25. All national affiliated organisations with 100 or more members would have a seat on the steering committee. </p>\n  <p>o We appeal to local community, trade union and campaigning organisations to invite CNWP speakers to their meetings. </p>\n  <p>o We organise a CNWP speaking tour in May out of which we aim to develop local CNWP campaigns in those areas where they don\'t yet exist.</p>\n  <p>o We organise CNWP fringe meetings at as many trade union conferences as possible.</p>\n  <p>o We give support to genuine socialist and anti-cuts, anti-privatisation campaigns in the local elections.</p>\n  <p>o We ask the steering committee to act to develop the campaign as far call a second national conference, by the end of March 2007 at the latest, to assess the progress we have made and look at how we take the campaign forward from here. <br>\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Resolution Two</strong> : Socialist Alliance</p>\n  <p>The SA welcomes the initiative of the SP in setting up the CNWP, and offers its full support for the Campaign. We urge the March 19 Conference to launch the CNWP to ensure the following:</p>\n  <p>1. A data base is set up of Supporters/Signatories to the CNWP Petition/Conference delegates, and that such potential members are subsequently grouped by region or area<br>\n    2. These regional/area groupings are used to contact local trade unionists, tenants, left groups/alliances, community activists and other local progressive forces, with a view to organising regional/county/town/community launches of the CNWP, which would be expected to elect their own local Organising/Interim Steering Committees<br>\n    3. The CNWP Committee is asked to start considering which type of structure would best suit a Campaign for a New Workers\' Party that would encourage supportive left groups/alliances, unions, independents, tenants, community groups and others to work towards unity at their own pace.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Resolution Five</strong> : Reading CNWP group</p>\n  <p>This national conference of the CNWP congratulates the Socialist Party on its initiative in calling this conference. There is a clear need for a new party that represents the interests of workers and their families as opposed to the New Labour government that sides with big business.</p>\n  <p>If a new party is to succeed it must be open, inclusive and democratic and represent all strands of the Labour and Trade Union movement as well as those struggling in their communities against cuts in services and conditions. As well as appealing to traditional left groups and trade unionists the CNWP must reach out to those millions that have opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and those that campaign on environmental issues, pensions, racism and tenants rights, etc.</p>\n  <p>If we are to succeed no single group or organisation must be allowed to dominate any new party that may emerge from this conference or future conferences. </p>\n  <p>We must learn the hard lessons of previous attempts to unite the left such as the Socialist Labour Party and the Socialist Alliance. </p>\n  <p>We must put in place mechanisms that ensure that full and frank discussions are allowed and a wide range of opinions are represented on all policy making bodies. </p>\n  <p>We should try to see that from the outset, in all our meetings and literature etc., propaganda for the individual groups/parties is seen as clearly distinguishable from propaganda on behalf of a new mass party.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Resolution Nine</strong> : International Socialist Resistance (ISR) (REMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE)</p>\n  <p>Growing up in the Britain New Labour have created is no joke. Over generations the trade unions and the working class have fought for the right to a decent life and the right to a future. That is now being snatched back by this government and the big business fat cats they represent. </p>\n  <p>Our education system is being sold off to the highest bidder. Our hospitals are being shut down due to a lack of money while the oil companies declare the most obscene profits ever. We are told there is no money to pay us a decent wage while city workers get millions in bonuses alone. There is no lack of money or wealth or resources but there is a system that allows the wealthiest to own and control the majority of trade to run for their own profit. But around the world and in Britain young people are not taking this sitting down. </p>\n  <p>Blair has claimed that young people are apathetic towards politics. He claims this in the face of more and more young people participating in demonstrations and campaigns; in the face of school students booing him during his general election campaign; in the face of over 75% of young people taking part in civic and political activities outside school. The truth is that young people are apathetic towards him, his party and the other parties of big business.</p>\n  <p>Many initially became active around the issue of the invasion of Iraq. This was significant in a whole number of ways. It gave many, and school students in particular, their first taste of political activity. It brought some up against the forces of the state and many have since drawn on those conclusions to form political analyses. </p>\n  <p>Since then, a whole range of international events have provoked a development of consciousness and questioning of capitalism. The tsunami, Asian earthquake, Hurricane Katrina and other environmental disasters have made the massive chasm between rich and poor impossible to ignore. The G8 meeting in Gleneagles raised discussion on both the question of poverty and what is the solution and to an extent was part of the larger discussion on the environment that is taking place. </p>\n  <p>But it is not the international issues alone that are posing such devastating questions in the minds of young people in Britain. While a minority will be politicised by these issues even more are forced to think about it because of their experience of coming up against it in their day to day lives. </p>\n  <p>Students in schools and colleges around the country are experiencing the reality of league tables, privatisation and all the other aspects of Labour\'s plans for education. Over-testing, under-resourcing, fees, the abolition of the grant, student debt, student poverty, student stress to get a good degree, to get a good job; this is the student experience in both the higher and further education sectors.</p>\n  <p>Many young people are workers as well as students and mainly through agencies or on temporary contracts. Over half (54 per cent) of graduate jobseekers, who left university in 2004 or earlier, are still looking for their first graduate job, according to a report released in August by Manpower. </p>\n  <p>While young people in Britain do not have identical experiences as those in France there are similar features to both. The criminalisation of young people, the application of ASBOs and the other attacks on the rights to protest and strike combined, in the case of black and Asian youth, with racist police harassment will contribute to the anti-establishment and to a certain extent alienation from society that is one side of the response to the attacks.</p>\n  <p>During previous elections ISR has campaigned against privatisation, against racism, against the war and occupation of Iraq and against low pay. We have also campaigned for votes at 16 but have always linked that demand to the need for a political party that will actually represent 16 year olds and all young people.</p>\n  <p>We want a party that will represent us and fight for our future. We want a party that is clearly democratic, where we can have a say as socialists and as young people. We therefore support the initiative to launch a campaign for a new mass workers\' party. At our 2002 conference we resolved to fight for a new party that will be a genuine political alternative and which will:</p>\n  <p>* Offer a radical voice for workers and young people, a genuine socialist alternative to the profit-driven policies of all the mainstream parties. <br>\n    * Stand against war and imperialism, and support the international solidarity of oppressed peoples. <br>\n    * Guarantee decent pay and rights at work for all workers. <br>\n    * Abolish tuition fees and guarantee all students a living grant to support them through their education. <br>\n    * Fight against discrimination on the basis of race, disability, gender or sexuality. <br>\n    * Be funded by, and run in the interests of, the masses not the millionaires. </p>\n  <p>We believe that the Socialist Party\'s initiative is our best chance to achieve this.<br>\n    Therefore we call on conference to agree to make every effort to involve young people in the campaign, to ensure that there is representation of young workers and students on the organising committees and that material is produced that will appeal to the experiences of young people growing up in Blair\'s Britain.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Resolution Ten</strong> : Resolution on steering committee </p>\n  <p>1) Given the early stage of development of the campaign any structure we set up will of necessity be interim and, to some degree, ad-hoc.<br>\n    2) However, it is important that we elect an interim steering committee from today\'s conference in order to coordinate the work effectively whilst ensuring that different points of view are heard.<br>\n    3) We therefore agree to elect a secretary, chair, vice-chair, treasurer, trade union liaison<br>\n  officer and press officer who will together act as a day-to-day coordinating committee.<br>\n  4) In addition we agree to form a broader interim steering committee which will meet at least once a quarter. The steering committee will be made up of: the officers; one representative per affiliated political organisation with 100 or more members; one representative elected by each group meeting at today\'s conference (one for each trade union present, plus one for community campaigns, and one for youth and student groups). <br>\n  5) We agree to invite those national trade union leaders who see the need for a left alternative to New Labour to attend as observers or full members, as decided by the trade union. <br>\n  6) The steering committee has the right to co-opt new members or observers prior to the next conference in the event of new forces becoming involved in the campaign. At the next conference we will review the structure of the steering committee.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>The following Officers were elected:</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    Chair: Dave Nellist; Secretary: Roger Bannister; Vice Chairs: Kevin Kelly &amp; Jeremy Dewar; \n    Press Officer: Pete McLaren; Treasurer: Fiona Pashazadeh; Ass Sec: Hannah Sell; \n    Trade Union Liaison Officer: Glenn Kelly<br>\n  </p>\n  <p align=\"left\"><br>\n  </p>\n'),(11,'CNWP Press release 28 March 2006: Supporting the Local Authority Workers\' Strike',4,3,'  <p><b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;\"Times New Roman\";color:black\'>CAMPAIGN FOR A NEW WORKERS PARTY</span></b></p> \n  <p><b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;\"Times New Roman\";color:black\'>For further information go</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'> </span></b><b><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;\ncolor:black\'>to</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'> </span></b><b><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;\ncolor:black\'>www.cnwp.org.uk</span></b><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;color:black\'> </span></p> \n  <p><b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'>Press</span></b><b><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;color:black\'> </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:18.0pt;\nfont-family:Verdana;color:black\'>Officer:</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'> </span><b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black\'>Pete McLaren</span></b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-family:Verdana;color:black\'> </span></p> \n  <p><b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'>Tel: 07881 520626</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:\nVerdana;color:black\'> </span></p> \n  <p><b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'>Email:</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'> </span><b><u><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'>info@cnwp.org.uk</span></u></b><span lang=EN-GB style=\'font-family:\nVerdana;color:black\'> </span></p> \n  <p><b><u><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Verdana;\ncolor:black\'>julie.mclaren@virgin.net</span></u></b><span lang=EN-GB\nstyle=\'font-family:Verdana;color:black\'> </span></p> \n  <h1 style=\'line-height:200%\'><i><span\nlang=EN-GB style=\'font-size:24.0pt;line-height:200%;\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:normal\'>FOR IMMEDIATE USE 28<sup>th</sup> MARCH </span></i></h1> \n  <h1 style=\'line-height:200%\'><span lang=EN-GB>SUPPORTING THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WORKERS STRIKE </span></h1> \n  <h1 style=\'line-height:200%\'><span lang=EN-GB>ON MAR 28</span></h1> \n  <p style=\'line-height:200%\'><span lang=EN-GB style=\'color:black\'>Members and supporters of the Campaign for a New Workers Party (CNWP) will be joining picket lines on Tuesday to show their full support for local authority workers in their industrial action against any increase in the minimum retirement age. Many thousands of workers have already lost much or all of their pension rights, with the retirement age already raised to 65 for new starters in the NHS, Civil Service and teaching.

Blair wants us to work until we drop. Despite being the fourth richest country in the world, the Labour Government says it can not afford decent pensions. The truth is that as the economy expands, the rich get richer whilst poverty worsens.

The real &quot;pensions gap&quot; is between rich and poor. The rich monopolise more and more of the wealth of society. They get better pensions, and live longer to enjoy them. Over the last 20 years, employer contributions to occupational pension schemes have fallen from about 15% of salary to only 5% today. And governments have let the basic state pension erode so as to ease the tax burden on the well-off and big business.</span></p> \n  <p style=\'line-height:200%\'><span lang=EN-GB style=\'color:black\'>&quot;The Labour Government, Tories, and Liberal-Democrats all agree on making the majority pay more for pensions, work longer, and get less.

Matters Arising</h3>\n<p>a) Declaration signatures &#8211; It was announced these now stood at 3067, adding that this figure would quickly rise if we were more active. <span class=\"name\">Dave Nellist</span> suggested we improve the emailing of our monthly bulletin to supporters, group supporters locally, and devise a standard response for all new signatories. <span class=\"em\">These suggestions were agreed</span></p>\n<p>b) Web site &#8211; It was reported this was being regularly updated, and there had been an increase in visitors to the site, with up to 34,000 hits a month, although the number varied.

At this meeting, it was agreed that local supporters of the campaign would write to all unaffiliated trade union branches urging them to stand candidates in the upcoming council elections. Officers agreed that this was a good initiative and called on other regional CNWP supporters to organise similar public meetings.</p> \n\n<h3>4.CNWP National Conference</h3>\n<p><span class=\"em\">The following actions were agreed:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Conference be held in London on Sunday June 22 (now June 29), 1 5pm, the day after the NSSN conference.</li>\n<li>The first hour would include a debate on the need for a new party with left TU speakers, or a debate\nwith the LRC, leaving the rest of the conference to deal with internal matters </li>\n<li>A Rally on international issues and a Social would be arranged for the Saturday night</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5.

Trade Union Conferences</h3>\n<p>It was agreed to organize CNWP Fringe meetings at all major TU conferences this year, prioritizing the RMT, CWU, PCS and NUT. A forum/debate was suggested, to involve the CNWP with those on the left who disagreed with our campaign for a new workers party. <span class=\"em\"><span class=\"name\">Terry Pierce</span> agreed</span> to work on a new leaflet for these meetings, and agreed to book venues.</p>\n<p>It was further agreed to fully implement all the proposals put forward by the Steering Committee, as follows\n<ul>\n<li>Organise local CNWP meetings to explain why the RMT are standing in the GLA elections</li>\n<li>Find ways of organising CNWP signatories separately in each TU</li>\n<li>Produce a good quality leaflet on disaffiliation/breaking the link</li>\n<li>Produce a CNWP leaflet/broadsheet on the CNWP and the trade unions </li> \n<li>Draw up a timetable of TU conferences</li>\n<li>Provide model resolutions for branches</li>\n<li>Attempt to get CNWP speakers on TU platforms, even at small meetings</li>\n<li>Use our web site to publicise contacts for each Union</li>\n<li><span class=\"name\">Glen Kelly</span> and <span class=\"name\">Terry Pierce</span> to work with individuals in each trade union to work out the best strategy for work on disaffiliation within the 15 TUs affiliated to Labour, and to do the same within the 5/6 TUs not affiliated</li>\n<li>Need to work with local TUCs and offer to speak at local TUC meetings</li>\n<li>Contact TU broad lefts and target local, regional and special TU conferences, and training/weekend conferences, and offer CNWP speakers on &#8220;Breaking the Link&#8221;</li>\n<li>Put conference dates, venues and resolution deadlines on our web site</li>\n</ul>\n</p> \n\n<h3>8. How we progress the CNWP over the coming months</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> moved the resolution from the Socialist Alliance, left over from the Steering Committee, on </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CNWP to adopt a membership structure</li>\n<li>The CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and automatic representation from all supportive political organisations irrespective of size, and representation for independents</li>\n<li>The CNWP to establish working groups to develop the agreed policy points in the CNWP Charter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> argued the need for a timescale to be established in the campaign to build a new left party. He defined a campaign as an operation to achieve a purpose, and he argued the time had come to take stock and decide how close our campaign was to achieving its purpose. He explained that the SA felt that, by establishing membership, inclusive affiliation and policy discussion groups, the CNWP would start to develop into a pro party alliance &#8211; a pre-party formation. This would help towards achieving its purpose.</p>\n<p>There was some sympathy with the SA view, but the majority felt a timetable was not sensible, as the creation of a new party would depend on the tempo of the class struggle. Other points made were\n<ul>\n<li>Too early to talk about membership &#8211; we need at least double the number of supporters</li>\n<li>It took 20 &#8211; 40 years to form the Labour Party. There is no sudden route to a new Party</li>\n<li>Bolting together the existing left is not the answer, and we need to avoid being swamped by large groups like the SWP</li>\n<li>It is not up to the CNWP to actually set up a new party, its role is to help in that process</li>\n<li>We need a debate with TUs about how to go forward</li>\n<li>The last 12 months have been frustrating: McDonnells challenge quickly failed; Bob Crowe has not been working with others; there has been a lack of TU solidarity</li> \n<li>The CNWP does not have enough weight to stand its own candidates, but it can support others</li>\n<li>The rank and file who are doubting Labour do not yet relate to the CNWP</li>\n<li>Any new political movement must be built on the TUs &#8211; we need to break the TUs from Labour first</li>\n<li>The TU left has not forced the party question as expected</li>\n<li>The worst thing we could do is simply declare we are a new party &#8211; the left can not afford another failure</li>\n<li>What we do depends on the tempo of events &#8211; it could be a new party by the next General Election if the conditions are right</li>\n<li>We need to build on our TU work, but also reach out to other layers such as community groups</li>\n<li>We do need to address the criticism that the SP is using the CNWP to boost its own organization.</li>\n<li>We do need a new party today, based on the mass organizations of the working class, to unite the fight back. There is some urgency because of those who have now broken from Labour</li>\n<li>We need to establish local CNWP groups if enough local activists come together</li>\n<li>It is important to listen to those who feel frustrated with the pace of the campaign</li>\n<li>Membership needs to be looked at again before conference, if activity suggests it.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> replied to the debate, arguing that the resolution would move the campaign forward and start the long process of establishing a structure for what would still be a <span class=\"strong\">campaign</span> for a new workers party. <span class=\"name\">Dave Nellist</span>, in the chair, summed up what had been agreed earlier in the meeting, and suggested that if it all was successful, that could lead to a membership structure. He also felt there should be no timetable: if external events demanded it, or thousands came on board, a new political formation was more likely.</p>\n<p><span class=\"em\">The SA resolution was not put, and remains on the table</span></p>\n<p class=\"byline\">Pete McLaren 19/03/08</p>'),(15,'',0,4,'<h1>Reports</h1>\r\n<p>Click on the links on the right to read reports and documents from the Socialist Alliance.</p>\r\n'),(16,'Resolutions passed at the AGM 2007',1,4,'<h1>RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE SA AGM NOV 17 2007</h1>\n\n<h2>MOTION 1 PRIORITIES FOR THE SOCIALIST ALLIANCE</h2>\n\n<p>We recognise the progress made by the SA in the last 12 months towards implementing the tasks it was set by the 2006 AGM. We recognise the need to do more if the SA is to have a significant impact</p>\n\n<p>We call upon the newly elected NEC to continue<br />\nPrioritising producing a regular SA publication, <br />\nWorking with and developing SA branches, and <br />\nWorking both within and across socialist unity projects.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we agree<br />\nTo campaign, both ourselves as the SA and within the CNWP, for:<br />\nThe CNWP to adopt a membership structure<br />\nThe CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and automatic representation from all supportive political organisations irrespective of size, and representation for independents<br />\nThe CNWP to establish working groups to develop the agreed policy points in the CNWP Charter</p>\n\n<p>For discussions to commence about how best to approach all socialist unity projects â€“ including the CNWP, LRC, Respect/SWP, Respect Renewal, SGUC partners, CMP, DSA, tUSP, SUN, ISG, the RMT initiated National Shop Stewards Network, and other progressive red/green groups and individuals - with a view to inviting all socialist unity projects, left organisations and independent socialists to a conference in 2008 to discuss ways of uniting the left into one mass socialist, democratic, open and pluralist organisation which recognises and protects each component part whilst pursuing  commonly agreed goals.</p>\n\n<h2>MOTION 2 CAMPAIGNING FOR A SOCIALIST ALLIANCE </h2>\n\n<p>This AGM congratulates the Executive on securing the name and electoral registration of the Socialist Alliance for those who recognise the need for a socialist alliance. In promoting the Socialist Alliance and urging all socialists to join with us, we recognise we are a small organisation and that there is much work to be done before there is real unity of the left. Therefore our most urgent aim as the SA is to campaign for a new alliance of socialists which unitesÂ in one organisation the Labour Representation Committee, the CNWP, Respect, TUSP and the rest of the socialist and green socialist left, and is built on the principles enshrined in the work historically carried out by the Socialist Alliance. </p>\n\n<h2>MOTION 3 CNWP</h2>\n\n<p>The SA will continue to make a priority of our campaigning work with the CNWP. Our strategic aim is to transform the CNWP into an organisation along the lines of the original SA with local branches, a federal structure and programme along the lines of People Before Profit. We note that the Scottish Socialist Alliance was the launch pad for a new workers party, the Scottish Socialist Party. An alliance of socialists with unites the majority of the left can be part of a real movement for a workers party.</p>\n\n<p>Noting the further restrictions by the Brown leadership on democracy in the Labour Party and the crisis in Respect, it is more urgent that the CNWP begins to transform itself into a real organisation. The SA will intervene in the CNWP and where possible carry out our own initiatives to win over the Socialist Party and its rank and files members to building a more effective campaign.</p>\n\n<h2>MOTION 4 RESPECT</h2>\n\n<p>This AGM notes the crisis in Respect (who are holding their conference at the same time as the Socialist Alliance AGM). We deplore any further fragmentation of the forces of the left, while retaining our criticism of its non-socialist features and cross-class, bureaucratic organisation. The incoming SA EC is charged with reporting to the Alliance on the state of play vis-&#224;-vis Respect and whether any new openings have arisen for our project of socialist unity.</p>\n\n<h2>MOTION 5 PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT</h2>\n\n<p>This AGM calls on the incoming EC to begin the process of updating our manifesto People Before Profit, with a view to completing a new version by the May elections. This to be undertaken with the widest possible consultation with the membership, via meetings and e-discussion.</p>\n\n<h2>MOTION 6 DAY SCHOOL </h2>\n\n<p>This AGM recognises three major working class political traditions in Britain in Chartism, Labourism and Marxism.

He suggested we should only pay the cheapest possible fare for travel to meetings where the date was known well in advance. He also felt the pool fare &#8220;cap&#8221; could be raised. After a brief discussion, it was agreed the pool fare &#8220;cap&#8221; remain at &#163;5 unwaged &#163;10 waged. It was agreed to continue the arrangement that members of the committee were expected to use only the cheapest fare reasonably available to them. It was agreed that <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> and <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> would discuss a system of charging an amount for printing that reflected &#8216;wear and tear&#8217; It was noted that we need to raise money.</p>\n\n<h3>COMMUNICATIONS REPORT</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> reported that he had obtained and passed on to Gerry Byrne the passwords etc for the web site </p>\n\n<h3>REPORTS FROM LOCAL SOCIALIST ALLIANCES</h3>\n<p><span class=\"em\">Southampton:</span> no meeting since Feb 2007;<br />\n<span class=\"em\">Rugby Red-Green Alliance:</span> met before Xmas and was meeting again early February;<br />\n<span class=\"em\">Coventry and Warwickshire SA:</span> continues to meet monthly, and attendance had slightly improved; <br />\n<span class=\"em\">London:</span> no SA, but a number of members.

There was also opposition to &#8216;bolting together the disparate parts of the left&#8217;.  He added that CNWP Officers were meeting on Feb 9, Steering Committee in March. In the discussion, there was concern at the general lack of progress. <span class=\"name\">Dave Church</span> wondered what the SP&#8217;s  aim for the CNWP actually was. He could not understand why the CNWP could not have membership.</p> \n\n<h3>REPORT FROM THE AGS</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> tabled a report on AGS activity plus copies of the autumn Green Socialist journal</p>\n \n<h3>REPORT FROM SOCIALIST GREEN UNITY COALITION</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> reported the SGUC had met 3 Nov 2007, and would meet again soon. <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> reported he had written to Bob Crowe and the RMT about London elections but no reply. He would again write to &#8220;competitors&#8221; seeking to avoid clashes. The partners were agreeing joint policies for local elections</p>\n\n<h3>DATES OF AND VENUE FOR 2008 NEC MEETINGS</h3>\n<p>The following, all booked for 2 &#8211; 5pm, were approved:<br />\n<span class=\"em\">Sat March 1</span> - Old Joint Stock, Birmingham;<br >\n<span class=\"em\">Sat May 10</span> Lucas Arms, Grays Inn Rd, London; <br />\n<span class=\"em\">Sat July 5</span> - Lucas Arms, Grays Inn Rd, London</p>\n\n<h3>OTHER ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE</h3>\n<p>\na) Election of delegate to HOPI Committee - agreed Steve Freeman be the SA delegate to HOPI, with Toby Abse/Dave Landau as back up<br />\nb) Election of delegate to AGS Committee Meeting(s) - agreed Toby Abse be the SA delegate to the next AGS meeting on Jan 26th<br />\nc) SSP Conference decision to discuss a republican socialist strategy for the UK. <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> moved that we note the resolution and move on.

He felt the SGUC could play more of a role in uniting the left, in addition to its election work. <span class=\"name\">Toby Abse</span> felt there was little sign of worker discontent, and recent national demos had been small. He felt the National Shop Stewards Network had potential, and it was encouraging that both sides of Respect were supporting the TU Climate Change Conference on Feb 9. Mark Serwotka, in Socialist Review, complained about competing left projects and called for a unified approach &#8211; almost a bolting together. The SWP chose to publish it, and Mark Serwotka also had some support from the SP and LRC. <span class=\"name\">Dave Church</span> agreed with the idea of a delegate conference, perhaps in the summer, to explore how we could unite better. This may push the SP/CNWP into action.<br />\n<span class=\"em\">It was agreed:</span><br />\ni) to raise the matter for discussion at the next SGUC meeting<br />\nii) to propose to other organisations a delegate meeting be held on discussing ways of uniting the left, and/or exploring how we could unite better, possibly in the summer<br />\niii) for <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span>, as Secretary, to contact Mark Serwotka about unity</p>\n<p><span class=\"em\">b) WORKING WITHIN THE CNWP</span> (Motions 1 and 3) &#8211; left on the table: partly already discussed</p>\n<p><span class=\"em\">c) INTERNAL POLICY</span> (Motions 5, 6, 7 ,8)<br />\nIt was agreed that:<br />\n<span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> be asked to take forward the publication<br />\n<span class=\"name\">Steve Freeman</span> be asked to take forward the day school on Chartism as suggested in his notes<br />\nRevision of the manifesto be deferred until the summer, after the local elections, with 2 people to initiate</p>\n<p><span class=\"em\">d) GENERAL PRIORITIES FOR THE SOCIALIST ALLIANCE</span> (Motions 1 and 3) &#8211; already dealt with </p>\n<p class=\"byline\">Pete McLaren 01/02/08</p>'),(19,'SA NEC 1 March 2008',4,4,'<h1>REPORT OF THE SA NEC SAT MAR 1</h1> \n<h2>Old Joint Stock 2 &#8211; 5 pm</h2>\n\n<h3>IN ATTENDANCE</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span>; <span class=\"name\">Rickard Collins</span> (CAWSA); <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> took the chair, <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> agreed to help take the minutes</p>\n\n<h3>APOLOGIES</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Dave Church</span> (DLP); <span class=\"name\">Liz Peck</span>; <span class=\"name\">Toby Abse</span>; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span>; <span class=\"name\">Steve Freeman</span> (RDG)</p>\n<p>There had been a variety of unconnected reasons for the apologies, not least the fact that there were no trains in or out of Euston that day due to weather conditions.

This was agreed </p>\n\n<h3>COMMUNICATIONS REPORT</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> reported that CAWSA Member <span class=\"name\">Dave Trussler</span> had volunteered to improve and update the web site. The NEC was very grateful for this offer, and asked <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> to liaise with him</p>\n\n<h3>REPORTS FROM LOCAL SOCIALIST ALLIANCES</h3>\n<p>There were reports from CAWSA, and from Rugby RGA where the local Alliance had set up Rugby Against Racism And Fascism to counteract BNP activity in the area</p>\n\n<h3>CAMPAIGN for a NEW WORKERS PARTY REPORT</h3>\n<p>A written report from the CNWP February Officers meeting was circulated. It highlighted the new round of campaign material for supporters to use; organisation of TU conference fringe meetings; the next national CNWP Conference on Sun June 22 or 29; the need for local/regional CNWP meetings; and the opening of a blog on the CNWP web site to encourage discussion. <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> explained in some detail how the SP majority had argued against the SA resolution on membership and affiliation, and the need for a timetable to be established for when the Campaign could become a Party. However, there had been some recognition of the need to reconsider the possibility of membership, and creation of the blog provided opportunities for supporters to communicate with each other.</p>\n<p>It was agreed to ask <span class=\"name\">Steve Freeman</span> or <span class=\"name\">Toby Abse</span> to represent the SA at the next Steering Committee</p>\n\n<h3>REPORT FROM SOCIALIST GREEN UNITY COALITION</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> reported that the SGUC would be meeting on March 22, the agenda to include coordination of this years council elections challenge by the left, and the SA suggestion for the SGUC to work more actively towards socialist unity. <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> agreed to represent the SA, trains permitting.</p>\n\n<h3>REPORT FROM THE AGS</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> reported that the AGS were holding a Participatory Conference the following day, that their AGM was on March 15, and the next Committee was April 12. <span class=\"name\">Rickard Collins</span> agreed to represent the SA at the AGS Committee on April 12</p>\n\n<h3>MAIN DISCUSSION ITEM: PROMOTION OF SOCIALIST UNITY</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> circulated the letter he had sent from the NEC to <span class=\"name\">Mark Serwotka</span> asking for discussions on ways to advance socialist unity. He also referred to <span class=\"name\">Mark Serwotka</span>\'s major article on the need for a left alternative in a recent edition of The Socialist, and explained that the SP had asked him to write a response. This appeared unedited in this week\'s Socialist, with a further response from <span class=\"name\">Dave Nellist</span>. Both were circulated. He concluded by suggesting we use our July 5 booking at the Lucas Arms as a possible date for a delegate meeting to discuss ways of progressing socialist unity, and he had extended the time booked to 5 hours to accommodate that possibility.</p>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> felt it was difficult for a small organisation like the SA to attract significantly larger and more active groups like the SP &#8211; why should they listen to us? He asked whether we were an active organisation &#8211;  or just a think tank &#8211; an idea with a credible history as <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> had put it. He felt we would have more weight if we were active. <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> accepted we could only do what was feasible with our lack of resources and small national membership, but that it was important for us to be there to provide a national focus and to bring our influence to bear on socialist unity projects. The promotion of left unity remained a vital and worthwhile strategy for the SA to pursue</p>\n<p>The meeting agreed to a proposal from <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> to float the idea to left groups of a delegate meeting as outlined at the previous NEC, explaining this was a new proposal of a different nature to the conference, making it clear this was an exploratory meeting about possible unity, and tentatively offering July 5 in London as a possibility. Any decision on numbers of delegates to be left until we had responses. <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> agreed to draft an invitation on these lines and circulate to the NEC before sending it.\n</p>\n\n<h3>IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTIONS AGREED AT THE AGM</h3>\n<p>As well as the above, <span class=\"name\">Steve Freeman</span> had confirmed that he was in the process of organising the Day School on Chartism and Democracy, and would be circulating the petition on the Charter for a Democratic Republic.

However, travel to this meeting would use a lot of that balance. It was agreed to renew the PO Box and pay our share. <span class=\"name\">Mike Davies</span> suggested we had saved money by having two meetings on the same day. <span>Gerry Byrne</span> offered to draw up a Standing Form for regular donations, and suggested we look at raising the membership fee at the AGM</p>\n\n<h3>COMMUNICATIONS REPORT &#8211; including web site suggestions</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> suggested the following courses of action to raise our profile without incurring much expenditure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the web site more regularly &#8211; members to send content to our web person, <span class=\"name\">Dave Trussler</span> at <a href=\"mailto:mail@davidtrussler.net\">mail@davidtrussler.net</a></li>\n<li>Re-draft the home page &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> to liaise with <span class=\"name\">Dave Trussler</span></li>\n<li>Feature Reports of Left Unity meetings and activities &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> to do</li>\n<li>Set up and advertise a blog, which would change weekly &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> to organise</li>\n<li>Update our Wikepedia entry &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> to do</li>\n<li>Create a SA Facebook Group &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> to do</li>\n<li>NEC members to add a link to the SA web site on their emails &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> to organise</li>\n<li>Respond to articles in the left press, especially on left unity &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Toby Abse</span> to deal with those in Solidarity and The Socialist; <span class=\"name\">Eddie Adams</span> the Morning Star; <span class=\"name\">Steve Freeman</span> Weekly Worker</li>\n<li>Ask for stalls and a speaker at all Left Forums (eg Marxism, Socialism)</li>\n<li>Create a downloadable &#8216;Introduction to the SA&#8217; package for use at events &#8211; <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> to organise</li>\n<li>Intervene in other blogs and elists</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these proposals were agreed</p>\n\n<h3>REPORTS FROM LOCAL SOCIALIST ALLIANCES</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> reported that CAWSA continued to meet monthly and regularly had outside speakers to lead political discussions. <span class=\"name\">Liz Peck</span> reported that RRGA had campaigned vigorously against the BNP in the lead up to the May elections. <span class=\"name\">Gerry Byrne</span> reported that Tyneside Socialist Forum had discussed a left intervention at the Durham Miners Gala.</p>\n\n<h3>SOCIALIST UNITY</h3>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> circulated a written report from the CNWP Conference on June 29th, and gave a verbal report from the Left Unity Meeting which had taken place earlier today. He mentioned the success of the Open Forum at the start of the CNWP Conference, when a number of leading left activists and trade unionists had clearly called for a new left party. The Conference itself had pushed the CNWP forward: membership and members meetings had been accepted, and the SP had eventually dropped their opposition and amendment to our resolution stating that the time is right to start moving towards a pro-party alliance or a pre-party formation that, as well as campaigning for a new party, will also begin work to determine the structure and rules for such a party.</p>\n<p><span class=\"name\">Pete McLaren</span> felt the Left Unity meeting had definitely built on the achievements made at the CNWP Conference as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 different organisations had met together</li> \n<li>They had agreed to co-operate and meet again in October </li>\n<li>They agreed a joint press statement supporting public sector strikes </li>\n<li>They agreed to discuss internally, and then report back, on what each organisation&#8217;s position was on unity with other groups, including any barriers </li>\n<li>They had agreed to discuss that the body became some sort of liaison committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A number of comments were made in the discussion which followed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Secretary should produce a report from the Left Unity Meeting and put it on our web site</li>\n<li>We are moving forward: the SP has been prodded along by us</li>\n<li>Today&#8217;s Left Unity meeting gives us something more than the CNWP and might help push things on independently</li>\n<li>It was amazing that the meeting happened in the first place, and even more amazing that it would meet again</li>\n<li>The meeting showed that supposedly disparate groups can now get on</li>\n<li>The only real outcome was to hold another meeting</li>\n<li>Some organisations are looking to us because of our history</li>\n<li>We do not know if anything will come out of all this &#8211; a lot has happened in the last few weeks</li>\n<li>A report of the meeting is important &#8211; representatives will now go back and reflect and then give their organisation&#8217;s view next time.

Â </p><p>Mike Davies (AGS) explained that the AGS favoured moves towards socialist and green socialist unity, but we needed to do more than just cobble together small organisations.Â  He stressed the importance of environmental issues, and argued we needed an outcome from the meeting.Â  Any new organisation must avoid predation, cult of the leader, and be accountable.</p><p>Steve Freeman (RDG) described how the last 10 years had seen the left trying to find a new formation without lasting success.Â  The RDG supported a new socialist party which included the Labour Left and Marxists.Â  It needed an international perspective.Â  Today was part of that process.</p><p>Simon Wells (CPGB Central Ctte) explained that the CPGB were involved in a number of campaigns, including the CMP and HOPI.Â  They also had members in Respect and the Left Alternative. Â </p><p>Clive Heemskerk (SP NEC) agreed we needed a new political organisatiion for the working class, and we should combine the forces of those working for working class political representation.Â  He felt what we could accomplish in the short term was limited.Â  He agreed with an international approach, and explained how the CNWP was part of the strategy to fill the vacuum to the left of Labour. Â </p><p>Tom Unterrainevl (AWL) explained how the AWL was raising the need for working class political representation within Respect, the Labour Party and the trade unions, which was where they were concentrating their work.Â  The AWL now concluded that Labour could not be reclaimed.Â  The AWL was in favour of left unity, hence its membership of the SGUC.Â  We needed an honest accounting of past left failures before we can sort out where we are at now.Â  As a minimum for the next General Election, we should make sure there was the largest possible number of left candidates and that clashes were avoided.</p><p>Dave Church (Walsall DLP) outlined how the DLP wanted to be part of a national and international organisation, something like Labour could have become in the 1970â€™s - a single party of the left.Â  Moves towards such a party would be strengthened if existing left groups agreed to act together.Â  We need to leapfrog a SGUC type structure and not all groups can avoid clashes at elections.</p><p>Andy Hewett (Green Left) explained that the GL was a growing group inside the Green Party pushing eco-socialism.Â  It was open to the idea of left unity, and had an international perspective.Â  The fragmentation of the left was a problem.Â  The Green Party, though clearly not socialist, had a number of socialist policies.Â  The GL supported a bottom upwards approach to political organisation, believing strongly in grass roots politics.Â  The GL wanted to see how we could work together, and they wanted to take something away from the meeting today. </p><p>Wil McMahon (Respect Co-ordinating Committee) agreed we all wanted working class political representation - he would want that to have a socialist content whereas trade unions may not be so explicit, so we should think about a baseline.Â  Respect was unfolding as an organisation and was building more local branches.Â  Respect was in favour of left co-operation, and accepted it was not the only show in townÂ  Communication was essential. </p><p>Pete McLaren (Socialist Alliance NEC) suggested it was vital that this meeting built on the spirit of unity and general moves forward experienced at the CNWP Conference the previous Sunday.Â  He felt the suggested accounting function, which in some ways had already started today, was one way forward.Â  He put forward the key issues from a SA perspective: federalism or any other structure that prevents domination by any one group and encourages affiliation from all supportive political organisations, enabling groups to retain their identity and traditions; democracy and inclusivity; freedom of expression;Â  anti sectarianism; co-operative and positive ways of working; the 80/20 principle of working together on issues we have in common whilst trying to resolve those we disagree upon</p><h2>PROPOSALS FOR ACTION</h2><p>After a short break, the following proposals were put forward:</p><ul><li>Intervene at the Manchester Convention of the Left</li><li>Produce a Joint Statement in support of the public sector strikes</li><li>Agree, where we can, on electoral clash avoidance</li><li>Ask the GL and LRC to try and find a mechanism to avoid clashes from their perspective</li><li>An accounting function - each group to establish the minimum it would accept and explain what barriers there could be for a new left party.Â  What does each group want for a new left party? This to be discussed internally by groups before this group met again, put in writing where possible</li><li>We form a Left liaison Committee to have dialogue on the process as it unfolds</li></ul><p>Organisations commented on these proposals.Â  Tom Unterrainevl (AWL) rep saw little opportunity for a new organisation in the foreseeable future.Â  We should continue to co-operate and liaise.Â  Andrew FisherÂ  (LRC) felt we definitely needed a Liaison Committee.Â  Regarding the GE, they would focus on 7 key left seats and ask their members to support other left candidates.Â  They could identify those candidates they would want the left not to oppose, and suggested the GL could do the same for Green candidates.Â  Gerry Byrne (SA) suggested pooling all the various 10 point policy bullet points from the different organisations, establish a framework we could all adopt for clash avoidance, and approach the Convention of the Left for a slot to discuss left unity.Â  Mike Davies (AGS) wanted the fullest agreement possible on clash avoidance. Steve Ballard (tUSP) wanted this group to reach out to unaffiliated anti-capitalist activists.Â  Steve Freeman (RDG) wanted this body to gather information on where organisations stand and what the differences were. </p><h2>THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE AGREED:</h2><ol><li>Produce a Joint Statement in support of the public sector strikes - Gerry Byrne (SA) to initiate and circulate</li><li>Each organisation to discuss internally, in the light of this meeting, its position on cooperation and unity with other groups, including what barriers there might be.

What kind of person delights in the destruction of peoples lives, the lives of the persecuted with no rights, money or resources, thrown out of their shacks and makeshift tents and on to the streets?  This is the attitude of a racist bully allied to the interests of the ruling class.  It certainly is not the attitude of a socialist and should have not place in the labour and trades union movement.</p><p>That the Home Secretary can say this shows just how low the New Labour Government has stooped with regard to immigration.  They put pressure on the French authorities to close down the Red Cross Centre in Sangatte.  The \"jungle\" was the result.  Now they put pressure on the same authorities to trash the lives of those who remain.  For what?  To look tough, to appease the fearmongering of the tabloid newspapers and the fascists.  This can only lead to a strengthening of those fascists.</p><p>Socialist Alliance expresses its solidarity with the migrants in Calais.  We re-iterate our opposition to all immigration controls in general and in particular demand the right of the migrants in Calais to come to this country if they wish, without risking life and limb in or under lorries and trains.</p><p>No One is Illegal!</p><p>Proposed by David Landau</p><h2>MOTION FIVE</h2><h3>WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!<br />JOBS FOR ALL WHO NEED AND WANT THEM!</h3><p>Conference notes that across the world  the recession is biting and jobs are being lost.  Workers everywhere are competing for jobs and those in jobs are fighting to maintain their conditions of work - harder as the competition gets more bitter.  But this is because of the insane economic  system.  There is no good reason for unemployment. There is plenty of useful work to be done, especially in the construction industry.</p><p>There are homeless people around the country, there are thousands of dilapidated houses lying empty, there are people living in the freezing cold because they cannot afford to heat homes that need insulation.  And yet construction workers cannot get a job and fight over the right to build oil installations.  There is plenty of work to be done in Britain, Italy, Portugal and other places.  The threat to jobs isn\'t from other workers from other places or other countries.</p><p>Conference is alarmed at  the emergence of the slogan \"British Jobs for British Workers\" in recent struggles.  Instead of workers being united in the struggle for jobs, wages and conditions workers are being divided against each other instead of against the bosses.</p><p>Conference expresses its disgust at the appalling misleadership by Dereck Simpson who was featured in the Daily Star sandwiched between two young women wearing T-shirts adorned with the slogan \"British Jobs for British Workers\".  Although some more sober union leaders distanced themselves from this slogan they nevertheless followed the same nationalist agenda.  Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the TUC, talked about opposing the \"exclusion of British workers\" and the need to strengthen border controls.</p><p>The Socialist Alliance believes socialists must robustly oppose this approach.</p><p>There is an alternative.  The Socialist Alliance believes in uniting as an international class against the bosses and \'our\' governments and fighting on demands that can unite migrant and non-migrant workers.  EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK!  NO TO REDUNDANCIES!  INVEST IN SOCIALLY USEFUL WORK INSTEAD OF THROWING MONEY AT THE BANKS!  JOBS FOR ALL WORKERS! FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND THE RIGHT NOT TO BE UPROOTED!</p><p>Proposed by David Landau</p><h2>MOTION SIX</h2><h3>BNP &UKIP</h3><p>Conference expresses alarm at the election of two British National Party MEPs in the EU elections in June 2009 and the pushing of Labour into third place by UKIP in those elections.   A major reason behind this was the massive number of people opposed to the BNP and UKIP who did not vote at all because they were contemptuous of the mainstream parties and there was no credible alternative.  But it also reflected a significant vote for these parties that cannot be dismissed as a protest vote.  There was a huge list of candidates for whom a protest vote could be cast.</p><p>UKIP is not a fascist party but its leader Nicholas Farage regards Enoch Powel as his political hero because of the Rivers of Blood speech and the party campaigned strongly on an anti-immigration platform.</p><p>Conference notes that in less than five minutes of BNP\'s Andrew Brons being elected, Labour Minister Andy Burnham was on the radio saying how Labour must \"listen to what the electorate are telling us about immigration\".</p><p>Conference believes that the watchwords of the anti-fascist movement should be:</p><ul><li>No appeasement of the fascists on questions of immigration, Islamaphobia etc.</li><li>Defend communities - They Shall Not Pass.  These successes will embolden racists, fascists and bigots of all kind - more harassment and attacks and actions against communities - witness the EDL demonstrations against Muslims.</li><li>Build at the grass roots community level - not top down hierarchies that currently dominate the movements.</li><li>Anti-Establishment/Anti-Capitalist.  The BNP take advantage of the failure of the system to meet peoples needs.  There is a danger in the current anti-fascist groups getting to closely associated with mainstream politicians.</li><li>Hold the line on No Platform.</li></ul><p>Conference believes that a united anti-fascist movement is more necessary than ever.  But such a movement can never be sufficient to defeat fascism.  The success of the fascists of the BNP and the racist nationalists of UKIP speaks volumes about the lack of a serious working class socialist alternative to the bourgoeis political parties.  The Socialist Alliance must continue to fight for this alternative amongst the left, in the trades union movement and in working class community campaigns.</p><p>Proposed by David Landau</p>'),(26,'Amendments to motions for the SA AGM 10 October 2009',7,4,'<h2>Amendment to MOTION ONE: THE WAY FORWARD</h2>Â <p>Section B:</p><p>Delete paragraph beginning \"We also recognise that the No2EU-YestoDemocracy coalition...\"</p><p>In para beginning \"We note that there have been developments...\" delete \"post No2EU\" and replace in second sentence \"have arisen out of\" with \"include\"</p><p>In para beginning \"We welcome these developments...\" delete \"post-No2EU\".</p><p>InÂ  para \"Furthermore, we will campaign...\" reword to read \" for any electoral coalition which emerges to be open, inclusive, fully democratic and without bans and proscriptions.\"</p><p>In para beginning \"At the same time, the SA will ...\", delete \"both inside and outside post-No2EU developments\".</p><p>Add new para:<br />\"The SA will attempt to intervene in any trade union initiative such as the RMTâ€™s conference on working class representation along the lines of its own socialist politics, in particular to challenge the nationalist bent of CPB-inspired fronts, and to emphasise the unity of all workers and for the free movement of labour.\"</p>Â <p>Proposed: Gerry Byrne</p>'),(41,'Secretaryâ€™s Report to the 2009 SA AGM',8,4,'<h1>SECRETARYâ€™S REPORT TO THE 2009 SA AGM</h1> <h2>INTRODUCTION â€“ A POSITIVE YEAR</h2> <p>Given\r\nwhat we faced at the last AGM in December 2008, and the size of our\r\nactive membership, our political progress since then has been quite\r\nremarkable. Last December, we were faced with a motion which, by\r\ncalling for merger, would have effectively closed us down. At the same\r\ntime, our ambitions for the Euro Elections in June 2009 were to try and\r\npersuade the rest of the left to help raise enough finances to stand a\r\nâ€˜left listâ€™ in one of the thirteen English regions. </p> <p>The merger\r\nmotion was heavily defeated, and within months we were part of the\r\nfirst ever serious trade union/left co-coordinated challenge to New\r\nLabour, a coalition sponsored by the RMT which stood in every Euro\r\nregion in England, Scotland and Wales, and had the only national TV\r\nbroadcast to concentrate on undermining the BNP. Two members of the SA,\r\nincluding the National Secretary, were candidates for\r\nâ€˜No2EU-Yestodemocracyâ€™ as the coalition came to be called. Others\r\nbecame part of the campaign. The Socialist Alliance was mentioned in\r\npublicity to an audience we could only have dreamt to reach. We have\r\nsince agreed to engage with post No2EU developments which are likely to\r\nlead, at the very least, to a trade union/left coalition contesting the\r\nGeneral Election next year. Whilst all this was taking place, we have\r\ncontinued to co-ordinate what has come to be called the Left Unity\r\nLiaison Committee (LULC), and there have now been 5 meetings in 15\r\nmonths involving up to 15 different socialist/green socialist\r\norganisations in an attempt to encourage and enable the left to work\r\nmore effectively together. At the same time, we have continued our\r\nactive involvement in the Campaign for a New Workersâ€™ Party (CNWP)\r\nwhich has been encouraging supporters to become members to implement\r\nthe policy we suggested at the last CNWP national conference. The CNWP\r\nhas put most of its energies into No2EU and post No2EU developments,\r\nand there has therefore been limited independent activity, but\r\ncampaigning for a new workersâ€™ party has been to the fore of the No2EU\r\nand subsequent developments, and calls for such a party were made at\r\nmany Public Meetings and included in publicity. All this has advanced\r\nour main aim of bringing all socialist unity projects together as part\r\nof One Party of the Left based solidly within the working class. </p> <h2>GENERAL ACTIVITIES</h2> <p>The\r\nNEC met 3 times, the minimum laid out in the Constitution. As well as\r\nthe AGM, there was a Members Meeting in April to formulate our policy\r\non No2EU. Much of the discussion at NEC meetings was on socialist\r\nunity. In January, we heard reports of our involvement in the\r\nConvention of the Left, where we had argued, by resolution, for\r\ndiscussions about how a new left party could be formed. We also tried\r\nto get support for our Euro Election Appeal for funds. Both were\r\nrejected, and we had to put real pressure on the organisers just to\r\nallow these suggestions to be debated. The Convention did however agree\r\nto send a delegate to the LULC, which could prevent further splits. At\r\nthe NEC meeting itself in January, we gave critical support to the\r\nPeoplesâ€™ Charter, agreed to collate the various charters which were\r\nemerging, decided to continue with the European Election Financial\r\nAppeal, and agreed to try and persuade the AGS to re-join the LULC. The\r\nmembers meeting, which followed the April NEC, agreed to critically\r\nsupport No2EU, and to raise the issue of Democracy. In June, the NEC,\r\nafter hearing a report from the post No2EU core group, decided to\r\nengage in any post-No2EU developments which broadly fit within our\r\nagreed policies. It heard that the main players within No2EU â€“ the SP,\r\nRMT, CPB and AGS â€“ were meeting in July to discuss their positions, and\r\nthat further developments were likely after the summer holiday period.\r\nIt was agreed to write to the RMT asking if we could send an SA\r\nrepresentative to subsequent post-No2EU meetings. Attendance at NEC\r\nMeetings was as follows:</p> <p> Toby Abse: NEC Meetings attended (maximum 3) 2; Apologies 1</p> <p> </p> <p>Gerry Byrne: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies â€“ </p> <p>Jean Kysow: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies â€“ </p> <p>Dave Landau: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies â€“ </p> <p>Pete McLaren: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies â€“ </p> <p>Liz Peck: NEC Meetings attended 1; Apologies 2 </p> <p>Alliance for Green Socialism: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 0 </p> <p>Coventry And Warwickshire SA: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 1 </p> <p>Revolutionary Democratic Group: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies â€“ </p> <p>Rugby Red Green Alliance: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 0 </p> <p>Walsall Democratic Labour Party: NEC Meetings attended 1; Apologies 1 </p> <p>There\r\nhas been regular communication with members, both by email and, on a\r\nnumber of occasions, by post to those members not on email. Members\r\nwere kept informed of developments as they took place. Dave Trussler\r\nhas continued to maintain and develop the web site. Unfortunately,\r\nthrough no fault of our own we lost our domain name at the end of July,\r\nand the site was down for two months. This was because our former web\r\nperson did not send on the domain renewal notices he received. We have\r\nnow bought the domain â€œwww.socialistalliance.org.ukâ€ from the Socialist\r\nParty, and the Site is back up and running with the same information as\r\nbefore. Membership remains much the same as last year, nationally and\r\nlocally. No new local Alliances have emerged, but those already in\r\nexistence have continued to meet and promote activity in their\r\nlocality. </p> <h2>PRIORITIES FOR THE SA AGREED AT THE 2008 AGM</h2> <p>Only one resolution was passed at the 2008 AGM, and this was our main guide for activity since then. The main points were:</p> <ul> <li>A recognition of the progress made in terms of promoting socialist unity and turning the CNWP into a more effective campaign.</li> <li>Welcoming developments which had led to the formation of a Left Unity Liaison Committee</li> <li>\r\nAgreement that the main priority in the year ahead was to build on\r\nthese two developments, and to take forward as far as possible a\r\ncampaign for One Party for the Left (ie the socialist movement) based\r\nsolidly within the working class</li> </ul> <p>Specifically, the AGM agreed to:</p> <ul> <li>Actively\r\nseek greater positive co-operation within the left and the green left;\r\nand take forward a campaign for One Party for the Left based solidly\r\nwithin the working class â€“ with the intention that such a party would\r\nhave support from trade unions, tenants groups, women, youth, black\r\ngroups, anti-war protesters and environmentalists â€“ within the LULC,\r\nthe CNWP and the socialist movement generally</li> <li>Attempt to gain the involvement of left organisations not at this stage participating in the LULC</li> <li>Intervene in the CNWP to build a more effective campaign, transforming the CNWP into a real organization, and to campaign for: </li> </ul> <ul style=\"\" 40px;&#8221=\"â€â€â€â€\"> <li>The\r\nCNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and\r\nautomatic representation and representation for independents</li> <li>The CNWP to establish working groups to develop the policy points in the CNWP Charter</li> <li>The CNWP to establish a timescale for turning the campaign for a new workersâ€™ party into that actual party</li> <li>The\r\nCNWP to launch a national debate designed to galvanize opinion around\r\nsuch matters as the party name, aims, constitution, culture, and\r\nprogramme.</li> <li> Through the LULC, and in the CNWP, seek to produce\r\na report on â€œThe problems of forming one party for the socialist\r\nmovementâ€ as an authoritative and representative report. </li> </ul> <ul style=\"\" 40px;&#8221=\"â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€\"> <ul> </ul> </ul> <h2> IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY AGREED AT THE AGM</h2> <p>In the nine months since then, the following progress has been made:</p> <h3>LEFT UNITY LIAISON COMMITTEE (LULC) </h3> <p>The\r\nLULC has now had five meetings, three of them since the 2008 AGM.\r\nReports from these meetings can be found on our web site. In terms of\r\nspecifics:</p> <ul> <li>The LULC has discussed the Peoplesâ€™ Charter,\r\nand agreed to collate the various Charters from different left\r\norganisations into one document.</li> <li>It was unanimously agreed to\r\nsupport a proposal from the AGS that â€œThe issue of the environment\r\nshould be a pillar of any new joint organisationâ€</li> <li>It was agreed to continue pursuing the objective of clash avoidance at elections</li> <li>It\r\nwas agreed that a Discussion Paper on possible aims of this Liaison\r\nCommittee be circulated, and subsequently it was agreed that the LULC\r\nwould provide mechanisms for an exchange of views, co-operation,\r\nco-ordination, education, promotion of each otherâ€™s events, and unity\r\nin action. The aim would be to build a more effective socialist\r\nmovement as a movement. </li> </ul> <p> In March, the LULC had a\r\nlengthy discussion on the â€œNo2EU-YestoDemocracyâ€ RMT Euro Election\r\ninitiative, and in June there was an open and frank appraisal of the\r\nNo2EU Election Campaign, followed by a discussion about the way forward\r\nafter the European Elections, which included an analysis of the growing\r\ncalls for left unity from, amongst others, Bob Crow, Mark Serwotka,\r\nDave Nellist, the SWP and the AWL.</p> <p>All the main socialist and\r\ngreen socialist organisations have attended LULC Meetings, apart from\r\nthe SWP, and in total 15 left groups have sent representatives to\r\ndiscuss and promote left unity. These are the Socialist Party, Respect,\r\nthe Labour Representation Committee, the Campaign for a New Workers\r\nParty, CPGB, Workers Power, the Democratic Labour Party, Workers\r\nLiberty, the Communist Party (CPB), RDG, Socialist alliance, Green\r\nLeft, Alliance for Green Socialism, the United Socialist Party, Left\r\nAlternative. The SWP have been invited, and they have acknowledged our\r\nsupport for their proposed left conference. </p> <h3>* CAMPAIGN for a NEW WORKERSâ€™ PARTY (CNWP) </h3> <p>The\r\nSteering Committee and Officers have each only met once this year\r\nbecause the CNWP gave immediate and full support to No2EU,\r\nconcentrating its efforts on building it. In the meantime, CNWP\r\nsupporters have been encouraged to become members, and 229 had done so\r\nby July. A Steering Committee has been called for the end of October,\r\nand there will be a Members Conference early in the New Year</p> <h3> * NO2EU-YESTO DEMOCRACY</h3> <p>â€No2EU-YestoDemocracyâ€\r\n- the coalition initiated by the RMT for the European Elections on June\r\n4th â€“ took up most of the leftâ€™s energy from March, and continues now\r\nwith post No2EU developments. The coalition was initially set up by the\r\nRMT, CPB, AGS and SP. The CNWP soon gave its support. and, after a\r\nlengthy discussion at a meeting of members, the Socialist alliance\r\nagreed in late April to give critical support. This initially proved to\r\nbe too late to become part of the Core Group which has continued to\r\nmeet post No2EU to put together a coalition for the General election. </p> <p> </p> <p>Those\r\nwanting the SA to engage with No2EU argued that the initiative should\r\nbe supported as a historic trade union based challenge to New Labour -\r\nif the left could not get its act together at a time of severe economic\r\ncrisis and potential rise of the far right, then when could it? The\r\nmain reason for engagement was the projectâ€™s potential. Links would be\r\nformed which would not necessarily disappear after June 4. The left was\r\nincreasingly coming onboard and Left groups were already able to use\r\nthe programme to promote their own slant. It would be an active\r\ncampaign with many public meetings, leaflets and stalls, and these\r\ncould help lay the basis for a new left party which would clearly have\r\ntrade union support. There would be a National TV broadcast. </p> <p>\r\nThe main policies of No2EU-yestodemocracy were to challenge the\r\nundemocratic nature of the EU, and to counter the BNP. It did not call\r\nfor withdrawal from the EU, despite the impression which may have been\r\ngiven in the registered electoral title. Full details of the manifesto\r\npolicies can be found at www.no2eu.com. There was some criticism within\r\nthe SA about the policies being too much of a concentration on the EU\r\nas the cause of all our problems, and what could be described as\r\nnationalistic solutions. However, two resolutions of critical support\r\nwere passed at the Members Meeting</p> <h3> THE NO2EU-YESTODEMOCRACY EURO ELECTION CAMPAIGN â€“ AN ANALYSIS</h3> <p>\r\nIn the Euro election itself, the No2EU campaign averaged 1%, which was\r\nnot dissimilar from the SA in 2001 (1.62%) and only just behind the SLP\r\nwho had the name and had been in existence for 12 years. It was the\r\nsame % as the SSP got in Scotland on June 4, and this was despite an\r\nabsence of media coverage and only being in existence for 9 weeks. </p> <p>\r\nHowever, the result, along with those for others on the left, pales\r\ninto insignificance compared to the results of the far right. UKIP\r\ngained 17%, pushing Labour into 3rd place, and the BNP gained two MEPs,\r\nboth hard line fascists and racists. The left needs to address this\r\nquickly. Divisions within the left made it easier for the far right to\r\npose as the â€˜acceptableâ€™ alternative to the political corruption and\r\nreactionary policies of the establishment parties. Much of the BNPâ€™s\r\nmore recent support comes from working class traditional Labour voters,\r\nmany of whom only move to the BNP as a protest. In my view, and my\r\nexperience, where I have had to actively campaign against BNP\r\ncandidates in my own ward 3 times recently, most could be won over by a\r\nnew left party which offered a radical alternative without the extreme\r\nnationalism and racism of the BNP.</p> <p> The No2EU campaign itself\r\nwas a very active one with 150 Public Meetings/Rallies, 15 in the West\r\nMidlands where SA National Secretary Pete McLaren had been a candidate\r\non the list headed by Dave Nellist. This meant the SA got mentioned in\r\nWest Midlands leaflets, and also in some of the eighteen press releases\r\nin the West Midlands where Pete McLaren was also Press Officer. </p> <p>\r\nThere was a Freepost to 50% of the entire electorate, plus hundreds of\r\nthousands of local leaflets with an organisationâ€™s own uncensored\r\npolitics. There was a successful TV broadcast, especially against the\r\nBNP. No2EU did provide a working class alternative to BNP by taking\r\nthem on â€“ it gave a better option than just â€œDonâ€™t vote BNPâ€. Most SA\r\nmembers felt the No2 EU campaign had been significant â€“ trade union\r\nsupport was clearly there, specifically from the RMT, but the FBU made\r\na donation, and the PCS President spoke at the London Rally. Increasing\r\nnumbers of left groups had come on board â€“ SP, CPB, AGS, Solidarity,\r\nSA, ISG, Respect local branches. But it was the developments that could\r\nwell come out of it that provided the most compelling reason to have\r\ngot involved in the No2EU-Yestodemocracy campaign</p> <h3> DEVELOPMENTS POST NO2EU</h3> <p>As\r\nnoted in the resolutions agreed for engagement with the\r\nNo2EU-Yestodemocracy European Election challenge, the SA was hopeful\r\nthat something more permanent on the left would emerge from it. </p> <p>There\r\nhad already been a number of developments by the time the SA NEC next\r\nmet on June 21st, and I was able to report the following information I\r\nhad received from Dave Nellist to the meeting:</p> <p>The SP executive\r\nhad confirmed their wish to build on the work of NO2EU for a joint list\r\nunder a common name for the GE, starting as soon as possible; the CPB\r\nand RMT were both meeting on July 11 to decide their view; there would\r\nbe a meeting of the core groups involved with No2EU in the 3rd week of\r\nJuly to assess the way forward and this group was likely to\r\nsubsequently meet monthly; there would be campaigning amongst the Irish\r\ncommunity in Britain on the Lisbon Treaty referendum vote, including a\r\nfringe meeting at the TUC with Joe Higgins; there would be a National\r\nConvention after the TUC Conference to decide details, structures etc\r\nfor the GE</p> <p> I went on to report that Jane Godrich (PCS Pres),\r\nRob Griffiths (CPB Gen Sec), Dave Nellist, and Bob Crow had all\r\noutlined the need for a unified <span style=\"\" bold;&#8221=\"â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€\">left electoral challenge as a step towards a new left party</span>\r\nat the London No2EU Rally on June 1st. Since then, a letter from Dave\r\nNellist had been published in a number of newspapers suggesting that\r\nLabourâ€™s decline and the BNP success showed the need for a left\r\npolitical alternative. Bob Crow on the BBC news Blog had called for\r\nurgent talks between socialist organizations and trade unions to build\r\na concerted political and industrial response to the election results,\r\nespecially the BNPâ€™s success, adding that the 150,000 votes (obtained\r\nby No2EU) provided a solid platform to build on. Mark Serwotka (Gen Sec\r\nPCS) was quoted in a SWP Open Letter stating that working people can no\r\nlonger vote Labour â€“ we need trade unions to stand candidates, he\r\nsuggested. </p> <p> In addition, a number of left organisations were\r\nshowing an increased willingness to work together. The SWP had\r\ncirculated an Open Letter calling for a left conference to discuss a\r\nâ€single, united left alternative to Labourâ€, and there had already been\r\npositive reactions to that, including one from the SA itself. In\r\naddition, the AWL was calling for a new Socialist Alliance, and the\r\nSocialist Party had produced a Paper outlining how they felt the left\r\nshould move forward, entitled â€˜No2EU: A step towards a workersâ€™\r\npolitical voiceâ€™</p> <p> After a lengthy discussion at the NEC about\r\nall these developments, much of which was about whether or not there\r\nshould be pre-conditions before the SA agreed to engage with post No2EU\r\npolitical developments, it was decided pre-conditions were not\r\nnecessary and it was agreed to engage in any post No2EU Left\r\ndevelopments which broadly fit within our agreed policies as in our\r\nConstitution. We welcomed the calls, by the SWP in their Open Letter,\r\nthe AWL call for a new Socialist Alliance, leading trade union figures\r\nsuch as Bob Crow and Mark Serwotka, for unity in the upcoming General\r\nElection, adding that we believed such moves, if they are to have any\r\nreality, must be democratic and involve the widest possible working\r\nclass forces, without bans and proscriptions. We agreed to campaign\r\nwithin any unity moves for the following conditions</p> <ul> <li>They are explicitly socialist, with a title and programme that reflects this;</li> <li>Their political programme is broadly in line with People Before Profit, the SAâ€™s election manifesto;</li> <li>That they explicitly reject nationalism and xenophobia and stand for equal rights for all;</li> <li>That they stand for full equality for all, and make no concessions to national, communal or religious interests</li> <li>That\r\nthey recognise that this crisis is an environmental as well as economic\r\nand any solutions must be sustainable for the planet as a whole.</li> </ul> <p>We\r\nagreed to fight within any unity project for our SA programme, and the\r\nNEC also recognized a â€œcrisis of democracyâ€ in the UK and agreed to\r\npromote the development of a democratic programme within the CNWP,\r\nConvention of the Left, No2EU and the LULC. </p> <p> The No2EU Core\r\nGroup has been informed of the SAâ€™s decision to engage in any post\r\nNo2EU political developments, and we await their response. The Core\r\nGroup met on July 20, and CNWP Officers heard later that day that:</p> <ul> <li> There would be meetings in support of an Irish No Vote on the Lisbon treaty </li> <li>A\r\nLeft Electoral Coalition was now being discussed for the General\r\nElection with a â€œclass based electoral titleâ€ â€“ an electoral block with\r\nsupport from trade unions and left organizations.</li> <li> It was\r\nhoped there would be agreement on a number of key demands, but\r\nsupporting organisations would also have to the freedom to promote\r\ntheir own programme â€“ a federal arrangement similar to how the SA\r\noperated in 2001.</li> <li>The steering group may be widened to include\r\nother supportative organisations, like the SA, after the next core\r\nmeeting on September 1</li> <li>There will be a national convention on the crisis in the lack of working class political representation in the autumn</li> </ul> <p>\r\nThe Core Group met again in September and agreed, (subject to\r\nratification by organisations), to form a coalition for the general\r\nelection. The next meeting would decide on a name and some core policy\r\npoints (covering socialist, democratic, environmental and trade union\r\nissues). The Core Group would then look at the involvement of other\r\ngroups, and the general practicalities involved.</p> <p> </p> <h3>CONCLUSION</h3> <p>Overall\r\n2009 has so far been a year of steady progress in terms of our agreed\r\npriorities, and gradual progress towards the formation of a new\r\nworkersâ€™ party. However, we remain very small in terms of membership,\r\nand we only have two officers when we should have at least five. I\r\ncannot continue forever to cover membership, finances and\r\ncommunications as well as being Secretary. Our resources are severely\r\nstretched. Yet, because of our background and tradition, we continue to\r\nhave an influence. We have avoided splits, despite some quite major\r\ndifferences of opinion, particularly around No2EU.</p> <p> In terms of the specifics of the resolution passed at the last AGM, we have</p> <ul> <li>Helped to develop work to encourage the left to cooperate and work more closely and effectively together</li> <li>Assisted the CNWP to turn supporters into members</li> <li>Taken forward our campaign for One Party of the Left, within the LULC, No2EU and throughout the left wherever possible</li> <li>Worked\r\nto gain the involvement of organistions not previously involved in the\r\nLULC, including the CPB, and we have re-opened contact with the SWP</li> <li>Continued to intervene in the CNWP whenever possible</li> </ul> <p>\r\nWhat we have not been able to do has been to move the CNWP further\r\nforward. This has been largely because the CNWP was effectively put on\r\nthe back burner from March until October in preference to work building\r\nthe Euro Election coalition No2EU, and in the subsequent Post-No2EU\r\ndevelopments towards a coalition for the General Election. With only\r\none Steering Committee meeting, one Officers meeting and no annual\r\nconference, it has not been possible to push it into being a more\r\neffective campaign with automatic representation for affiliates, policy\r\nworking groups, a report on the problems of forming one left party or\r\nthe need for a time table for the campaign for a new workersâ€™ party to\r\nbecome that party. With a further Steering Committee called for the end\r\nof October, agreement to hold a Conference early in the New Year, and\r\nthe move to a membership structure, the SA can now seek to promote\r\nthese policies within the CNWP with renewed vigor.</p> <p> More to the\r\npoint, it is what has objectively happened since last December, rather\r\nthan the specifics of a particular resolution, which should make us\r\noptimistic about the future. There have clearly been a number of\r\npositive moves towards greater left unity in the ten months since our\r\nlast AGM. </p> <p> The RMT initiated Euro Election challenge has, at\r\nthe same time, moved forward the campaign for a new left party and,\r\nwith our support, stood in all eleven regions of England, Wales and\r\nScotland. Although it was set up as an electoral coalition for just one\r\nelection, â€˜No2EUâ€™, for all its programmitical weaknesses, could well be\r\nthe catalyst for building a more permanent left party. In the 3 months\r\nsince the Euro Elections, the main â€˜No2EUâ€™ partners have laid the\r\nground for a coordinated left challenge at the General Election next\r\nyear. That would be a start. </p> <p> It was disappointing that\r\ninternal division delayed SA support for, and involvement in, â€˜No2EUâ€™,\r\nwith the result that we are not part of the main â€˜Coreâ€™ Post â€˜No2EUâ€™\r\nplanning group, but we have now agreed to engage with these post\r\nâ€™No2EUâ€™ developments, and hopefully we will soon be an active\r\ncomponent. This may well entail standing SA candidate(s) in the General\r\nElection as part of this coalition, a decision which will have\r\nfinancial and administrative implications we will need to address.</p> <p>\r\nIf we remain realistic about our role and our priorities, there is no\r\nreason why we cannot continue to play a part in left wing politics as a\r\nseparate body. Our determination to bring unity across the socialist\r\nand green socialist left is unique. We can continue to act as a sort of\r\npressure group for the unity of the left, arguing for it wherever we\r\nhave an audience, and promoting it through those wider projects within\r\nwhich we have already demonstrated we have a role to play, including\r\nthe LULC, CNWP, â€˜Post-No2EU developments and the Convention of the\r\nLeft. In many ways we are marking time, waiting for wider forces to\r\nagree the need for a new left formation or party, whilst at the same\r\ntime â€˜doing our bitâ€™ to speed up that process.</p> <p> <span style=\"\" bold;&#8221=\"â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€â€\">There has never been a more urgent time for the left to get its act together.</span>\r\nWith the establishment parties all vying to see which of them can best\r\nmake the working class pay for the Recession, through pay cuts,\r\nunemployment and massive cuts in public services, and with the\r\ncontinuing moves forward of the far right and the increased racism this\r\npromotes, there is a desperate need for a socialist alternative. Die\r\nLinke in Germany has shown what is possible in just two short years. In\r\nmany ways, it is a Left Party of compromise â€“ but it is a Left Party.\r\nWe could do worse than follow its example. This may well mean accepting\r\nthat some of our agreed policies do not feature in the new Partyâ€™s core\r\nprogramme, as we found with â€˜No2EU-YestoDemocracyâ€™. But it should not\r\nprevent our engagement, and once inside, we can argue for all that we\r\nhold dear, and, if appropriate, become a faction within the new\r\norganization to do so. There is no point in the 6 or 7 of us on the NEC\r\npreventing engagement because our own individual political crusade has\r\nnot been immediately recognized by whatever does emerge.</p> <p> The\r\nmain point is that we must accept that none of us on the left have a\r\nmonopoly of the truth; none of us know all the answers. What we do know\r\nis that we get nowhere as long as we remain divided. As we discovered\r\nin the early days of the original Socialist Alliance, we have more in\r\ncommon than not. We united then around the 80%, or at times 90%, we\r\ncould agree upon. A federal structure then allows organizations,\r\nincluding ourselves, to promote that other 10 or 20% as long as it is\r\nnot counter productive to the project as a whole. This has to be the\r\nway forward. We must continue promoting it at every level, whilst being\r\nrealistic about the amount of influence we can have. Our commitment to\r\nsocialist unity is more than just unique â€“ it is a vital component of\r\nthe new workersâ€™ party we are committed to build.</p> <p> We live in\r\ninteresting times. There is a renewed interest in unity, a new desire\r\nto provide a unified left alternative. There will be setbacks. Old\r\nsectarianisms will die hard. But the important thing is for us to be in\r\nthere, as the Socialist Alliance, representing all the traditions and\r\nachievements of the original SA, arguing for unity, openness,\r\nbottom-upwards democracy, honesty and inclusivity. That way we very\r\nmuch still have an important role to play, both as an independent\r\norganization and, in the future, as some sort of faction, for want of a\r\nbetter word, within something much larger, much more exciting, and with\r\nreal potential.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pete McLaren</span>, SA National Secretary 07/10/09</p>'),(50,'Report of the SA AGM Sat Oct 10 2009',9,4,'<h1>REPORT OF THE SA AGM SAT OCT 10 2009 2pm Lucas Arms </h1> <h2>WELCOME AND INTRODUCTIONS </h2> <p>Members\r\npresent: Ron Lynn; Jean Kysow; Gerry Byrne; Pete McLaren; Dave Landau;\r\nToby Abse; Dave Church (DLP); Steve Freeman (RDG).

He highlighted the progress\r\nhe felt the SA had made since the last AGM, when there was a motion to\r\neffectively close down the SA through merger, and when our Euro\r\nElection ambitions had been to raise enough money to fund a left list\r\nin one region, particularly to combat the BNP. In contrast, we had\r\nsurvived the merger motion, moved forwards, and had been part of the\r\nNo2EU Euro Election campaign which had contested all eleven regions. We\r\nhad implemented the resolution agreed at the 2008 AGM as far as we\r\ncould by: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Continuing to co-ordinate the LULC which had now held 5\r\nmeetings and had the support of all the main organisations on the left\r\n(15 in total) apart from the SWP, with whom we had now re-opened a\r\ndialogue. \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Promoting One Party for the Left through the LULC, CoL and\r\nNo2EU-YestoDemocracy \r\n </li>\r\n <li>By giving critical support to No2EU we had helped\r\nbring the left back together, as well as playing our part in moves\r\nwhich clearly promoted the need for a new left party. He was pleased to\r\nhave been one of two SA members to be No2EU candidates \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Assisting the\r\nCNWP to become a membership organisation, although he accepted that our\r\nadditional aspirations for the CNWP had been thwarted by the CNWP\'s\r\ndecision to put all its efforts into building No2EU and subsequent\r\ndevelopments \r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The report went on to highlight the achievements of the\r\nNo2EU campaign. It described the developments post-No2EU, with the Core\r\nGroup of the RMT, SP, AGS and CPB agreeing to coordinate a class based\r\nleft challenge in the General election. This notion had been given\r\nadditional support by the calls from a number of leading trade\r\nunionists, left organisers and socialist groups for left unity in the\r\nface of the resurgence of the right and the far right. \r\nThe Report\r\nconcluded by suggesting we had achieved all that we could have done,\r\nespecially given our size and lack of resources, and in many ways\r\ndevelopments had moved our campaign for One Party of the Left further\r\nforwards. By agreeing to engage with all Post-No2EU developments\r\nwithout pre-conditions, and to fight for our SA policies within them,\r\nwe had given ourselves further realistic targets for the coming months.\r\nEventually, the report suggested, the SA may seek to become a faction\r\nwithin a larger left organization/party. It was important that we\r\nremained realistic about our priorities and kept up our campaign for\r\nunity of the left as part of the process of building One party of the\r\nLeft. He also argued that we may well need to compromise on some\r\npolicies when joining a new organization, along the lines of the 80/20\r\nprinciple which had kept the original SA together, whilst continuing to\r\nfight for those of our policies the larger organization did not\r\nimmediately adopt. We should not insist on everything at once â€“ some\r\npolicies may need to be argued for. The 80%/90% we could all agree upon\r\nwould include all our main policies, at least in general terms, he\r\nfelt. Die Linke had been successful in Germany in this respect, polling\r\n15% after just two years. We were marking time at present, waiting for\r\nwider forces to move, and acting as a sort of ginger group to speed up\r\nthat process. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>b) Chair \r\n</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gerry Byrne</span> agreed we had been treading water,\r\nand felt there may no longer be a role for the SA. We could hardly be a\r\nfaction when we were divided down the middle as at present. We did not\r\nrepresent one political perspective, and could be facing the end of the\r\nroad. The SP had done to the CNWP what the SWP had done to the original\r\nSA, turning their energies elsewhere. They had simply used a CNWP\r\nSteering Committee decision to do what they wanted. She disagreed with\r\nthe Secretary about compromise on policy. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>c) Finance \r\n</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pete McLaren</span> spoke\r\nbriefly to his written report which showed a balance of Â£150.95,\r\ncompared to Â£127.95 at the end of 2008 â€“ but there was a further NEC\r\nmeeting and other activity to fund. We had cut down on travel and\r\nmeeting costs by only having three NEC meetings, but were light on\r\ndonations. He explained that our charge for printing needed to be\r\nraised as he was at present out of pocket. It was agreed in principle\r\nto raise the printing charge, and the NEC was asked to implement it.\r\nThe Finance Report was accepted \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>MEMBERSHIP AND AFFILIATION FEES \r\n</h2>\r\n<p>It was\r\nagreed to keep the Fees as agreed last year: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">a) Membership Fee</span> â€“Â£30/8\r\npa <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">b) Affiliation Fee</span> â€“ Â£50 for organisations with over 50 members; Â£40\r\nfor organisations between 25 and 49 members; Â£30 for organisations with\r\nup to 25 members; Â£15 for local alliances. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>AGM POLICY MOTIONS AND\r\nAMENDMENTS \r\n</h2>\r\n<p>The Chair, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gerry Byrne</span>, explained that the various suggested\r\nchanges to the Motion she was proposing was just one amendment, to be\r\nvoted on in full. She also gave up the Chair for this item in order to\r\nmove the amendment. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Steve Freeman</span> took the Chair. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pete McLaren</span> wanted\r\nthe amendment to be voted on in parts because some were more or less\r\nacceptable than others, but the Chair over ruled this \r\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pete McLaren</span>\r\nmoved <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MOTION ONE: THE WAY FORWARD</span> \r\n\"We recognise the general progress\r\nmade by the Socialist Alliance so far in 2009 \r\nA. Towards implementing\r\nthe tasks it was set by the 2008 AGM in terms of \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Developing work to\r\nencourage the left to cooperate and work more closely and effectively\r\ntogether \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Taking forward our campaign for One Party of the Left, within\r\nthe LULC, No2EU and throughout the left wherever we had the opportunity \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Working to gain the involvement of organistions not previously involved\r\nin the LULC \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Continuing to intervene in the CNWP whenever possible and\r\nassisting the CNWP to turn supporters into members, although\r\ndevelopments around No2EU-YestoDemocracy, and post-No2EU, have meant\r\nthat the CNWP has made limited progress so far this year \r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>B. In its\r\ncontinuing ability to influence the socialist movement, particularly\r\nthrough \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Its work in organising and promoting the LULC which now has the\r\nsupport of 15 left/green left organizations \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Its participation in the\r\nRMT inspired No2EU-YestoDemocracy European Election coalition, with a\r\nleading left trade union keen to have SA members, including the\r\nNational Secretary, as candidates \r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We also recognise that the\r\nNo2EU-YestoDemocracy coalition, which stood in every English region,\r\nand which the SA supported despite some programmatic misgivings, may\r\nwell have further promoted our goal of a new left party. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Such progress\r\nmust be measured against the situation at and immediately after the\r\n2008 AGM, when we had to fight off an attempt to effectively close down\r\nthe SA through merger, and when our aspirations for the European\r\nElections merely consisted of hoping to persuade other left\r\norganisations to join us in raising enough money to stand a left slate\r\nin just one region \r\n</p>\r\n<p>We note that there have been developments post No2EU\r\nwhich could lead to further progress towards our goal of a new left\r\nparty. These developments have arisen out of meetings of the post No2EU\r\ncore group (RMT, SP, AGS and CPB), and reported progress made so far\r\nincludes \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Discussing the formation of a Left Electoral Coalition for the\r\nGeneral Election with a \"class based electoral title\" â€“ an electoral\r\nblock with support from trade unions and left/green left organizations. \r\n </li>\r\n <li>Accepting the need to attempt agreement on a number of key\r\ndemands/policy points, covering socialist, democratic, environmental\r\nand trade union positions amongst others â€“ with an acceptance that\r\nsupporting organisations would also have the freedom to promote their\r\nown programme â€“ a federal arrangement similar to how the SA operated in\r\n2001. \r\n </li>\r\n <li>General agreement that other supportative organisations, like the\r\nSA, should be invited to join the discussions \r\n </li>\r\n <li>The calling of a national\r\nconvention on the crisis in the lack of working class political\r\nrepresentation in the autumn, which the RMT has now organised for\r\nNovember 7 \r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We note that these were agreed, subject to ratification by\r\norganizations, to be endorsed at the next core group meeting. We accept\r\nwe may need to be patient whilst organizations, especially the RMT,\r\nconsult their members before declaring public support. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>We also note the\r\nencouraging calls for left unity being made by a number of leading\r\ntrade unionists and socialist organizations, including Jane Godrich\r\n(PCS Pres), Rob Griffiths (CPB Gen Sec), Dave Nellist, RMT leader Bob\r\nCrow, Mark Serwotka (PCS Sec), the SWP, SP and AWL \r\n</p>\r\n<p>We welcome these\r\ndevelopments, and we endorse the decision of our NEC to engage in any\r\npost-No2EU developments which broadly fit within our agreed policies,\r\nand to campaign within them for a political programme which is broadly\r\nin line with People Before Profit, the SAâ€™s election manifesto â€“ we\r\nwill fight within them for our SA programme. To this end, we will\r\ncontinue to seek representation on the various bodies which emerge, as\r\nthey emerge. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, we will campaign for the Coalition which\r\nemerges to be open, inclusive, fully democratic and without bans and\r\nproscriptions. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>We will also campaign within it for it to develop more\r\npermanent structures, initially, at least, on a federal basis, which\r\ninclude individual membership as a step towards a new workersâ€™ party\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Once part of the Coalition, the SA will play a full part in it, which\r\nmay include standing SA candidates as part of the agreed umbrella,\r\nraising the necessary finances for that, and carrying out such\r\nadministrative tasks as this may entail. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the SA will\r\ncontinue its work to promote socialist unity both inside and outside\r\npost-No2EU developments\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>In the LULC</li>\r\n <ul>\r\n <li>Within the CNWP, and for the\r\nimplementation of our proposals on structure for the CNWP as agreed at\r\nthe 2008 SA AGM (affiliation and automatic representation; working\r\ngroups to develop policy). The need for a timescale for forming a new\r\nworkersâ€™ party, out of the campaign for one, to be taken in context\r\nwith, and conjunction with, developments elsewhere to build such a\r\nparty, including the post-No2EU coalition</li>\r\n <li>In the Convention of the\r\nLeft, if and when, that is possible</li>\r\n <li>And within any other unity\r\nprojects and progressive movements/campaigns \r\n </li>\r\n </ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We confirm that our main\r\ngoal is the merging of all such socialist/green socialist unity\r\nprojects and initiatives into one Party of the Left based solidly\r\nwithin the working class â€“ with the intention that such a party would\r\nhave support from trade unions, tenants groups, women, youth, black\r\ngroups, anti-war protesters and environmentalists\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gerry Byrne</span> then\r\nmoved the following amendment to Motion One \r\nSection B: \r\nDelete paragraph\r\nbeginning â€œWe also recognise that the No2EU-YestoDemocracy\r\ncoalition...â€ \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In para beginning â€œWe note that there have been\r\ndevelopments...â€ delete â€œpost No2EUâ€ and replace in second sentence\r\nâ€œhave arisen out ofâ€ with â€œincludeâ€ \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In para beginning â€œWe welcome these\r\ndevelopments...â€ delete â€œpost-No2EUâ€ . \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In para â€œFurthermore, we will\r\ncampaign...â€ reword to read â€œ for any electoral coalition which emerges\r\nto be open, inclusive, fully democratic and without bans and\r\nproscriptions.â€ \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In para beginning â€œAt the same time, the SA will ...â€,\r\ndelete â€œboth inside and outside post-No2EU developmentsâ€ . \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Add new\r\npara: \r\nâ€œThe SA will attempt to intervene in any trade union initiative\r\nsuch as the RMTâ€™s conference on working class representation along the\r\nlines of its own socialist politics, in particular to challenge the\r\nnationalist bent of CPB-inspired fronts, and to emphasise the unity of\r\nall workers and for the free movement of labour.â€ \r\n</p>\r\n<p>After a lengthy\r\ndiscusssion,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Pete McLaren</span> used his right of reply to argue against the\r\namendment. He felt that the amendment denied or watered down the role\r\nof No2EU, almost pretending it barely existed. In any case the main\r\nmotion clearly provided for engagement with Post- No2EU as well as\r\nother developments â€“ nothing was excluded. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In her right of reply to the\r\namendment, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gerry Byrne</span> felt the references to Post-No2EU did not always\r\nneed to be there. Without the amendment, the Motion suggested\r\nPost-No2EU was the only show in town. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Voting on the amendment was tied\r\nat 4 votes all. The Chair used his casting vote to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">defeat the amendment\r\nby 5 votes to 4.

This is the\r\nattitude of a racist bully allied to the interests of the ruling class.\r\nIt certainly is not the attitude of a socialist and should have not\r\nplace in the labour and trades union movement. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>That the Home Secretary\r\ncan say this shows just how low the New Labour Government has stooped\r\nwith regard to immigration. They put pressure on the French authorities\r\nto close down the Red Cross Centre in Sangatte. The \"jungle\" was the\r\nresult. Now they put pressure on the same authorities to trash the\r\nlives of those who remain. For what? To look tough, to appease the\r\nfearmongering of the tabloid newspapers and the fascists. This can only\r\nlead to a strengthening of those fascists. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Socialist Alliance expresses\r\nits solidarity with the migrants in Calais. We re-iterate our\r\nopposition to all immigration controls in general and in particular\r\ndemand the right of the migrants in Calais to come to this country if\r\nthey wish, without risking life and limb in or under lorries and\r\ntrains. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>No One is Illegal! \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Proposed by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dave Landau</span> \r\n</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Resolution was\r\nagreed by 7 votes to 1 </span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MOTION FIVE WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE! JOBS FOR\r\nALL WHO NEED AND WANT THEM! \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conference notes that across the world the\r\nrecession is biting and jobs are being lost. Workers everywhere are\r\ncompeting for jobs and those in jobs are fighting to maintain their\r\nconditions of work â€“ harder as the competition gets more bitter. But\r\nthis is because of the insane economic system. There is no good reason\r\nfor unemployment. There is plenty of useful work to be done, especially\r\nin the construction industry. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>There are homeless people around the\r\ncountry, there are thousands of dilapidated houses lying empty, there\r\nare people living in the freezing cold because they cannot afford to\r\nheat homes that need insulation. And yet construction workers cannot\r\nget a job and fight over the right to build oil installations. There is\r\nplenty of work to be done in Britain, Italy, Portugal and other places.\r\nThe threat to jobs isn\'t from other workers from other places or other\r\ncountries. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conference is alarmed at the emergence of the slogan\r\n\"British Jobs for British Workers\" in recent struggles. Instead of\r\nworkers being united in the struggle for jobs, wages and conditions\r\nworkers are being divided against each other instead of against the\r\nbosses. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conference expresses its disgust at the appalling misleadership\r\nby Derek Simpson who was featured in the Daily Star sandwiched between\r\ntwo young women wearing T-shirts adorned with the slogan \"British Jobs\r\nfor British Workers\". Although some more sober union leaders distanced\r\nthemselves from this slogan they nevertheless followed the same\r\nnationalist agenda. Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the TUC,\r\ntalked about opposing the \"exclusion of British workers\" and the need\r\nto strengthen border controls. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Socialist Alliance believes\r\nsocialists must robustly oppose this approach. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>There is an alternative.\r\nThe Socialist Alliance believes in uniting as an international class\r\nagainst the bosses and \'our\' governments and fighting on demands that\r\ncan unite migrant and non-migrant workers. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK!

A major reason behind this was the massive number of\r\npeople opposed to the BNP and UKIP who did not vote at all because they\r\nwere contemptuous of the mainstream parties and there was no credible\r\nalternative. But it also reflected a significant vote for these parties\r\nthat cannot be dismissed as a protest vote. There was a huge list of\r\ncandidates for whom a protest vote could be cast. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>UKIP is not a fascist\r\nparty but its leader Nicholas Farage regards Enoch Powel as his\r\npolitical hero because of the Rivers of Blood speech and the party\r\ncampaigned strongly on an anti-immigration platform. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conference notes\r\nthat in less than five minutes of BNP\'s Andrew Brons being elected,\r\nLabour Minister Andy Burnham was on the radio saying how Labour must\r\n\"listen to what the electorate are telling us about immigration\".\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conference believes that the watchwords of the anti-fascist movement\r\nshould be: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>No appeasement of the fascists on questions of immigration,\r\nIslamaphobia etc. </li>\r\n <li>Defend communities â€“ They Shall Not Pass. These\r\nsuccesses will embolden racists, fascists and bigots of all kind â€“ more\r\nharassment and attacks and actions against communities â€“ witness the\r\nEDL demonstrations against Muslims. </li>\r\n <li>Build at the grass roots community\r\nlevel â€“ not top down hierarchies that currently dominate the movements.\r\n </li>\r\n <li>Anti-Establishment/Anti-Capitalist. The BNP take advantage of the\r\nfailure of the system to meet peoples needs.

But such a movement can never be sufficient to defeat fascism.\r\nThe success of the fascists of the BNP and the racist nationalists of\r\nUKIP speaks volumes about the lack of a serious working class socialist\r\nalternative to the bourgeois political parties.

style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>It was the same % as SSP got <span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>in Scotland despite an absence of media coverage and only being\r\nin existence for 9 weeks.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>It had\r\nbeen a very active campaign with 150 Public Meetings/Rallies, 15 in West\r\nMidlands, a Freepost to 50% of the electorate plus hundreds of thousands of\r\nleaflets with organisationâ€™s own politics.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>There had been a successful TV broadcast, especially against\r\nthe BNP.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>No2EU did provide a\r\nworking class alternative to BNP by taking them on â€“ better than just â€œDonâ€™t\r\nvote BNPâ€.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>He felt the No2 EU\r\ncampaign had been significant â€“ trade union support was clearly there,\r\nspecifically from the RMT, but the FBU had made a donation, and the PCS\r\nPresident had spoken

style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>In his area, the BNP did well in Nuneaton, coming 2nd\r\nin 3 wards, but its vote fell in Rugby from 14.6% to 12%.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>He

unions\r\nand socialist parties in No2EU showed the possibility of a wider working class\r\ncoalition for future elections.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>He\r\nfelt a good start had been made in 9 weeks â€“ think what we could build in 9\r\nmonths for a General Election he suggested, asking anyone reading the letter to\r\ncontact him if they wanted to help build a new workersâ€™ party

read out a personal statement from Andrew Fisher of\r\nthe LRC that any left platform should also consider endorsing socialist Green\r\ncandidates and socialist Labour Party candidates, and a statement from the CNWP\r\nsuggesting it was important we build on the gains made by the No2EU campaign,\r\nand that any follow up initiative was widely based, democratic and inclusive.

style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>We should also build on the\r\nelectoral co-ordinating work of the SGUC, but trade union support was also\r\nneeded although he argued socialists should take the lead as trade unions were\r\nnot organised as a political party and their support did not always\r\nmaterialise.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>In Scotland some TU\r\nofficials were discussing using the Peoples Charter to measure candidates\r\nagainst â€“ this could include SSP, solidarity, the SNP, Greens and Labour\r\ndepending on their answers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:

was under way, involving left\r\norganisations and individuals from trade unions and political organisations.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>There were many political currents and\r\npolitical perspectives involved, therefore sensitivity was needed.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>There was still some residual support\r\nfor voting Labour to stop the Tories.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>There were issues of protocol and confidence.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>This all made it difficult for him to present everything,\r\nbut he

outlined how the process had arisen out of No2EU.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>A number of TU leaders had expresed\r\nsupport in a personal capacity, including Bob Crow, Chris Baugh (PCS), John\r\nMcInally (PCS) and Brian Caton (POA).<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>It had been provisionally agreed to have a Steering Committee which\r\noperated by consensus, and to contest all Cabinet Ministersâ€™ seats as a minimum\r\n- more were likely.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Local groups,\r\nas in Lewisham and Wigan, would be encouraged to become part of the Coalition\r\nwhilst retaining their local autonomy.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>Some core policies had been agreed, and these would be circulated after\r\nthe next meeting on January 7th, at which meeting the electoral title for the\r\nCoalition would be agreed following internal consultation within component\r\nparts.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Supportive organizations\r\nand individuals will be able to get involved, but organisations need to have\r\nsome \'social weight\' and be able to work by consensus.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Submissions from organisations already\r\nwanting to take part would also be discussed on January 7th.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>He concluded by stressing the\r\nimportance of

style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The core policies agreed so\r\nfar were not based on the Peoples Charter, and they are not controversial.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>One example was opposition to\r\nprivatization.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Supporting\r\norganisations can supplement them by producing their own material.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>No criteria has been laid down to\r\ndetermine \'social weight\', and all organisational requests to get involved will\r\nbe looked at on merit.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>What has\r\nbeen

stand, and he hoped the SP could move on from No2EU and\r\nthose who had opposed it.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>It was\r\ncrucial that we build on both No2EU and TUSC immediately after

on\r\nthe ground and clearly moved on and were discussing standing local candidates.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Bob Crow had been positive, but needed\r\nthe rest of us to send in proposals to move forward which the RMT could then\r\nact upon.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>In some ways, everyone\r\nwas waiting for someone else to make the next move.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>She was concerned that the SP seemed to be behaving\r\ndifferently in different forums, as it had been reported that they had blocked\r\nprogress at the recent Core Group meeting.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>Steve Freeman argued we need a national organization to\r\nco-ordinate the local campaigns.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>The RMT had set up the No2EU Coalition, and they needed the support of\r\npolitical groups to build for the General election.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>It was frustrating that the Conference had not discussed\r\nworking class political representation in terms of Parliamentary democracy â€“ we\r\nneed a Party to expose the concentration of power in the hands of the executive\r\nand suggest Parliamentary reform.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>No 2EU was a step forward, but we need the next step â€“ something like\r\nChartism.<span

style=\"font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:\r\nEN-US\">We need a single organization with a single name, but not a Party, for\r\nthe General election, he argued â€“ a loose umbrella with a central point until\r\nafter the election when we could start progress towards a more permanent\r\nstructure/new Party.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Steve Freeman\r\nmentioned that the Peoples Charter was being promoted, but it had no democratic\r\ndemands.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>We should intervene with\r\na republican charter and democratic demands including the need for\r\naccountability of MPs.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>Pete\r\nMcLaren felt the Conference had been successful given its brief.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The SP may not have been blocking\r\nprogress â€“ they may have decided that they needed something from the recent\r\nCore group meeting to put to the Conference, hence their decision not to push\r\nfor the name or core policies at the Core Group meeting, but instead to gain\r\nagreement on the launching of the Coalition itself, which they did through the\r\nagreed wording of the statement put to Conference.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:\r\nyes\"> </span>This had now been effectively endorsed by the Conference\r\nthrough the supportive speeches and via the leaflet everyone was given with the\r\nstatement and an update on progress.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>In answer to a query about the Convention of the Left only being\r\nrepresented at the Conference by one person, he was not surprised because the\r\nCoL did not want a new party any more than the Green Left or the Labour Representation\r\nCommittee did.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>The Post No2EU Core\r\nGroup was meeting again on November 25th, and he argued we should\r\nwrite to them on the lines suggested after the Conference by Nick Wrack, and he\r\nhoped all who supported the project would inform the Coalition at the address\r\non the Conference leaflet &#8211; electioncoalition@btinternet.com.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span>A brief discussion ensued about the\r\nnames being suggested for the Coalition.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> \r\n</span>Toby Abse suggested the new project might not be as democratically\r\norganized as it should be, but we needed to support it because of the massive\r\nspending cuts agenda being promoted by the main parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;\r\ntext-autospace:none\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:\r\nEN-US\">Dave Church moved that we write to the RMT and the Core Groups thanking\r\nthem for the Conference, hoping for further progress, offering the Coalition\r\nuse of our registered electoral title as a way of showing our commitment, and\r\nonce again requesting representation at all levels of the discussion.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span><b>This was unanimously agreed</b></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"
