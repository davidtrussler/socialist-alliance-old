          <td rowspan="2"><h3>A: Statement of aims</h3>
            <p>A1. The name<b> </b>of the organisation will be &ldquo;Socialist Alliance&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A2. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>promotes the ideas and principles of democracy and republicanism, an environmentally sustainable global socialism and working class internationalism. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>stands on the basis of the Socialist Alliance 2001 programme &ldquo;People Before Profit&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A3.&nbsp; The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>aims to win support in the working class movement for a democratically organised republican socialist party, along the lines of the Scottish Socialist Party.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Socialism&nbsp; - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is opposed to capitalism and imperialism. Socialism abolishes capitalism and economic exploitation and hence the necessity for social oppression. Socialism re-organises society on the basis of common social ownership and democratic control. </p>
            <p>A5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Republicanism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>identifies the working class as the only genuinely democratic class in society. In the United Kingdom the constitutional monarchist state is the main barrier to democracy and socialism. The struggle for democracy is the only road to working class self-emancipation. Our immediate political objective is to replace the constitutional monarchy with a democratic secular republic which includes the right of Ireland, Scotland and Wales to self determination.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Internationalism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is internationalist in its outlook. International capitalism is creating an expanding working class across the world. Building international working class solidarity and co-operation is central to the struggle for democracy and socialism. We oppose all capitalist policies which divide the working class along national lines including imperialist wars and foreign occupations.</p>
            <p>A7.&nbsp; Environment &ndash; The Alliance recognises the vulnerability of the ecosystem which sustains human life and the need to respect and sustain our environment rather than plunder and disrupt it. It recognises the importance of our local and global environment&nbsp; for the health, safety, welfare and continued existence of the world&rsquo;s people. In particular it regards global warming as a major threat to human civilisation and existence. It sees capitalism &ndash; with its ruthless pursuit of short term profit and its need for unending growth - as the major cause of environmental damage. It believes that only in a socialist society would it be possible for human activity to be environmentally sustainable.</p>
            <p>Socialist environmentalism has the potential to create an alliance of socialists, radical greens, trade unionists, and local activists who collectively identify and campaign on those issues which cause the greatest day-to-day suffering of the working class e.g. in housing, education, health, public transport, waste.&nbsp; Through inclusive grass-roots campaigns that have a democratic structure and transparent organisation the SA can help generate political action at both national and local level that actually politicises those taking part.</p>
            <p>A8. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is a campaigning organisation, seeking to win support for our ideas and policies in the socialist movement, the trade union movement and working class communities. We are prepared to work in and campaign within a broad range of socialist and working class organisations. We are prepared to stand in elections where circumstances indicate we have the support and means to do so.</p>
            <p>A9 A key element of an independent working class struggle against capitalism is the fight to make the trade unions assert themselves against the government. This must include taking up the fight to repeal the anti-union legislation, the fight for accountable union reps in the workplace, and a fight to disaffiliate unions from the Labour Party.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SA will establish clear democratic working class principles by which to assess any broader coalitions we may consider supporting. </p>
            <p>A10&nbsp; Anti-fascism - The Socialist Alliance recognises fascism as a clear and present danger to the working class here and across Europe with the rise of fascist and explicitly racist parties and will campaign for an anti-fascist united front to defend communities under attack and defeat fascism.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A11&nbsp; Fighting Specific Oppressions - The Socialist Alliance abhors the specific oppressions that people suffer due to their ethnic background, nationality, gender, sexuality, age, disabilities and health.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>These oppressions effect people in all classes, but particularly threaten the working class by potentially dividing sections of the class against each other.&nbsp; These oppressions can only be finally banished when class society itself is swept away but must be challenged in the hear and now. </p>
            <p>A12.&nbsp; The Socialist Alliance is not a party. We are not set up in opposition to other working class groups and parties. We are an alliance. This means we have independent members and members from a range of socialist parties and organisations. We are not seeking to persuade members of other socialist organisations to leave their organisations. We expect comrades to act within their own organisations to promote our common aims and consider membership/affiliation to the SA. </p>
            <p>A13.&nbsp; The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is a democratic organisation. We believe in openness of ideas and freedom of expression and believe this is the best method of building an effective campaigning organisation for a new workers party.</p>
            <h3>B: Membership</h3>
            <p>B1: Membership is open to all who broadly agree with the aims of the SA and accept its aims and programme as the basis for common activity.<b> </b>Members are expected to support an anti-sectarian, co-operative and positive way of working and help to ensure that any critical debates are conducted in a positive manner and without personal attacks.</p>
            <p>B2:&nbsp; A member must pay the appropriate subscription to the Socialist Alliance. Local branches may seek additional donations from their own members as decided locally.</p>
            <p>B3.&nbsp; Members of other parties, organisations and groups who join the Socialist Alliance are expected to be able to keep their identity as members of these organisations whilst participating fully within the development of the Socialist Alliance.</p>
            <p>B4: Individual members are thus welcome from other groups and organisations and membership of these &ldquo;must be declared on application for membership, and changes declared on renewal of membership&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;B5: The annual fee for individual membership will be determined by the Annual Conference of the Socialist Alliance. Where ever possible members will be allocated to the nearest local branch. Where this is not practical members will remain national members. Membership is on the basis of membership of only one local Socialist Alliance at any time. </p>
            <p>B6:&nbsp; Socialist, environmentalist, working class and other appropriate organisations can support the Socialist Alliance by paying an affiliation fee. Affiliates are encouraged to publicise SA activities and consult and co-operate with the SA wherever possible.</p>
            <p>B7:&nbsp; Membership of the Alliance carries an obligation not to obstruct campaigns decided on by the Alliance. We recognise, however, the right of minorities publicly to promote their views. In the event that an organised minority intends to take any action conflicting with a majority decision nationally or locally, that minority should inform the Alliance at the relevant level of its intention to do so.</p>
            <h3>C: National policy-making and structures</h3>
            <p>C1: National policy will be decided democratically by an Annual Conference, open to all members. A Conference Arrangements Committee will be elected to ensure the conference is organised and conducted democratically.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>C2: There will be political meetings and conferences of the Socialist Alliance in addition to the Annual Conference, open to all members to attend, at the discretion of the National Executive or on the basis of a request from 25 percent of the membership. Such conferences may alter the policy and constitution of the Socialist Alliance.</p>
            <p><b>National Executive </b></p>
            <p>C3: The implementation of national policy and national activities between Conferences, and the organisation of the Annual and any other Conferences, will be carried out by the National Executive, which will be elected at the Annual Conference. </p>
            <p><b>The Council of Socialist Organisations </b></p>
            <p>C4:&nbsp; All affiliated socialist and working class organisations and affiliated local Socialist Alliances have the right to two delegates to the Council of Socialist Organisations. The Council should meet regularly as it determines and no less than once every three months. The Council will comprise of no more than three National Officers meeting with delegates from affiliates. The SA officers, in consultation with affiliates, will draw up a provisional agenda and notice of the meeting. All affiliates have a right to place any matter on the agenda for discussion and the order of agenda will be decided by members of the council at the start of the meeting.</p>
            <p>C5: The purpose of the Council is to assist in securing the maximum unity in action and closest co-operation between the SA and its affiliates. The Council seeks to encourage constructive dialogue and non-sectarian but critical exchange of views amongst affiliates themselves. </p>
            <p>C6: The Council can take majority decisions, but these are not binding either on affiliated organisations or on the Socialist Alliance. These decisions are to be reported back to delegating bodies as recommendations. These may then become the basis for joint action involving the SA and some or all of its affiliates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p><b>Election and powers of the National Executive </b></p>
            <p>C7: A twelve person National Executive will be elected at conference by the method of single ballot STV.&nbsp; The National Executive will decide what specific officer posts there should be and will elect these positions from among their number. Conference Arrangements Committee will be responsible for producing a detailed protocol of how the ballot will be run and carrying it out at conference.</p>
            <p>C8: The National Executive will meet bi-monthly. Individual non-executive members may attend such meetings by invitation of the National Executive. The National Executive will endeavour to decide issues wherever possible by agreement but where no agreement is possible decisions will be made by majority vote.</p>
            <p>C9: The National Executive will be responsible for the running of the national organisation, for finance, membership, arrangements of national meetings, communications with local groups and individuals, national bulletin or paper production and distribution, liaison with other groups and organisations, arrangements for seeking and enabling electoral unity; and any other matters delegated to them by the Annual Conference.</p>
            <p>C10: The National Executive will have the power to disaffiliate local Socialist Alliances and remove individual membership or refuse to ratify candidate selection if it is concluded that the basic statement of aims has been breached by a Socialist Alliance, by an individual member or by a candidate.</p>
            <p>C11: Decisions of the National Executive relating to affiliation of local organisations or ratification of candidates can be appealed to the Annual Conference. The Annual Conference has the final authority to decide all issues relating to the Socialist Alliance.</p>
            <p>C12: The Socialist Alliance may be dissolved by a resolution of a Special Meeting, called for this purpose by the National Executive&nbsp; or by request of 25 percent of the membership, provided such resolution receives a two thirds majority of those present and voting. At least two weeks written notice of any such Special Meeting, including any motion to dissolve, must be given to all members and affiliates; but accidental error or omission in giving such notice to a small number of members or affiliates shall not invalidate the meeting.. Any assets of the Socialist Alliance shall be distributed to any organisation or organisations having aims consistent with those of the Socialist Alliance, as agreed at such a Special Meeting.</p>
            <p class=MsoBodyText>C13: The constitution of the Socialist Alliance may be changed by resolution of the Annual Conference or by resolution of a Special Meeting open to all members called by the National Executive, or by request of 25 percent of the membership of the Socialist Alliance, provided such resolution receives a simple majority. </p>
            <p><b>Appeals Committee</b></p>
            <p>C17: Conference will elect an Appeals Committee with a membership of three, who must not be members of the executive. The committee shall elect a convenor from amongst its membership, who will have the right to attend the executive on a non-voting basis.</p>
            <p>The functions of the committee shall be as follows:</p>
            <p>i). Membership - Where a local alliance or national body wishes to reject an application for membership, or expel an existing member, the request must be made in writing to the appeals committee, who will have the final decision.</p>
            <p>ii). Disputes - Any disputes about the balance of rights and duties between individual members or members platforms, or complaints about the conduct of individuals or members platforms shall be referred to the appeals committee. The decision of the committee will be binding on all parties concerned.</p>
            <p>iii). Elections - Where disputes arise locally around endorsement of candidates, which seats are to be contested etc, the executive may ask the appeals committee to investigate the situation and make recommendations for a course of action. The final decision on these matters will remain with the executive.</p>
            <p>The expectation is that all disputes should be resolved locally where possible, in line with the SA&rsquo;s principles of non-sectarian, positive co-operation. Disputes should only be referred to the appeals committee where local attempts to find a resolution have failed. All decisions of the appeals committee can be overturned at a conference by a simple majority vote.</p>
            <h3>D: Local Socialist Alliances</h3>
            <p>D1: Local and regional organisation will have to be flexible to take account of the fact we are a small but growing organisation and the fact that effective campaigning and fighting different kinds of elections will require different organisational forms. These local and regional Alliances must however demonstrate that they comply with certain common criteria in order to be viable. </p>
            <p>(a) the Alliance has an organising group (or steering committee) with specific named responsibilities (including treasurer and membership secretary).</p>
            <p>(b) the Alliance has a regular meeting, publicly advertised, open to all members (and potential new members).</p>
            <p>(c) The Alliance maintains an up-to-date membership list and provides membership details to the national organisation as required.</p>
            <p>D2: The boundaries of a Socialist Alliance should in the first instance be a matter for members to determine locally. If there is dispute over boundaries, this may be referred to the National Executive with the right of appeal to Conference. </p>
            <p>D3: Local Socialist Alliances should operate on similar principles to the National Executive, trying to reach agreement where they can but deciding issues by majority vote where they cannot.</p>
            <p>D5: Recognition of local and regional Socialist Alliances as affiliates of the Socialist Alliance nationally will be determined by the National Executive, subject to review by the National Conference.</p>
            <h3>E: Selection of candidates</h3>
            <p>E1: The local Socialist Alliance will have the responsibility for all elections contested by the Socialist Alliance within its area&nbsp; and for all arrangements regarding local candidate, agent, treasurer, in line with Socialist Alliance requirements nationally.</p>
            <p>E2: Socialist Alliance candidates must be selected at properly notified meetings open to all Socialist Alliance members of the appropriate local organisation on the basis of one member, one vote. If a Socialist Alliance does not exist in an area where someone wishes to stand as a Socialist Alliance candidate, a local Socialist Alliance can be established by the National Executive to carry out a selection process. The national Nominating Officer should monitor the selection of candidates and report regularly to the National Executive. In case of dispute or objection to the selection of any Socialist Alliance candidate, confirmation of nomination must be sought from the National Executive</p>
            <p>E3: The&nbsp; local Socialist Alliance or&nbsp; the National Executive, in consultation with one another, may nominate the Socialist Alliance candidate to stand in a particular election in exceptional circumstances. The final decision will lie with the Nominating Officer who is accountable to the National Executive.</p>
            <p>E4: Socialist Alliance candidates will be expected to support the agreed policies of the Socialist Alliance and to promote the Socialist Alliance on public platforms. </p>
            <p>E5: Should Socialist Alliance candidates be elected to office, they will be expected to support Socialist Alliance national policy.</p>

            <p>All members have the following rights:</p>
