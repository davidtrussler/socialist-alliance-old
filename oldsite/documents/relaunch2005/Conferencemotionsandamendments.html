<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"AGaramond Bold"'>RESOLUTIONS
WITH THEIR AMENDMENTS FOR NOV 12</span></h1>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></h1>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>RESOLUTION G</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:
normal'> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Proposed Constitution of the Socialist Alliance [2005] – from the Officers of the SA (P), to be moved by Pete McLaren and
Seconded by Steve Freeman </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>A: Statement of aims</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A1.  The name<b> </b>of
the organisation will be “Socialist Alliance”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A2. The Socialist
Alliance<b> </b>promotes the ideas and principles of democracy and
republicanism, an environmentally sustainable global socialism and working
class internationalism. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>stands on the basis of
the Socialist Alliance 2001 programme “People Before Profit”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A3.  The Socialist
Alliance<b> </b>aims to win support in the working class movement for a
democratically organised republican socialist party, along the lines of the
Scottish Socialist Party.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A4.   Socialism  -
The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is opposed to capitalism and imperialism.
Socialism abolishes capitalism and economic exploitation and hence the
necessity for social oppression. Socialism re-organises society on the basis of
common social ownership and democratic control. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A5.  
Republicanism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>identifies the working class as
the only genuinely democratic class in society. In the United Kingdom the constitutional monarchist state is the main barrier to democracy and
socialism. The struggle for democracy is the only road to working class
self-emancipation. Our immediate political objective is to replace the
constitutional monarchy with a democratic secular republic which includes the
right of Ireland, Scotland and Wales to self determination.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A6.  
Internationalism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is internationalist in its
outlook. International capitalism is creating an expanding working class across
the world. Building international working class solidarity and co-operation is central
to the struggle for democracy and socialism. We oppose all capitalist policies
which divide the working class along national lines including imperialist wars
and foreign occupations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A7.  Environment
–  The Socialist Alliance recognises the importance of the local and global
environment on the lives of the world’s people, their health, safety and
welfare. The greatest threat to the environment comes from the drive for
corporate profits. The best defence of the social interest is in the democratic
self organisation of the working class, full democratic rights, full freedom of
information and scientific knowledge. Socialism will replace capitalism with
social production organised on the basis of global social needs and world
ecological sustainability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A8. The Socialist
Alliance<b> </b>is a campaigning organisation, seeking to win support for our
ideas and policies in the socialist movement, the trade union movement and
working class communities. We are prepared to work in and campaign within a
broad range of socialist and working class organisations. We are prepared to
stand in elections where circumstances indicate we have the support and means
to do so.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A9.  The Socialist
Alliance is not a party. We are not set up in opposition to other working class
groups and parties. We are an alliance. This means we have independent members
and members from a range of socialist parties and organisations. We are not
seeking to persuade members of other socialist organisations to leave their
organisations. We expect comrades to act within their own organisations to
promote our common aims and consider membership/affiliation to the SA. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>A10.  The
Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is a democratic organisation. We believe in openness
of ideas and freedom of expression and believe this is the best method of
building an effective campaigning organisation for a new workers party.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>B: Membership  [<i>All subsequent
words in italics are taken from the existing SA (2001) constitution.</i>]</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>B1: Membership is

co-operative and positive way of working and help to ensure that any critical

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>B3.  <i>Members of
other parties, organisations and groups who join the Socialist Alliance are
expected to be able to keep their identity as members of these organisations
whilst participating fully within the development of the Socialist Alliance.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>B4: Individual
members are thus welcome from other groups and organisations and membership of

Socialist Alliance at any time. </i></span></p>

working class organisations can support the Socialist Alliance by paying an
affiliation fee. Affiliates are encouraged to publicise SA activities and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>B7: <i> Membership
of the Alliance carries an obligation not to obstruct campaigns decided on by
the Alliance. We recognise, however, the right of minorities publicly to
promote their views. In the event that an organised minority intends to take
any action conflicting with a majority decision nationally or locally, that
minority should inform the Alliance at the relevant level of its intention to
do so.</i></span></p>

membership. Such conferences may alter the policy and constitution of the
Socialist Alliance.</span></i></p>

officers are responsible for overseeing and progressing the work of the
alliance between executive meetings. The Officers will have an editorial
function for approval and publication of leaflets and publications. [When it
becomes possible to produce a paper an editorial board should be elected and
the constitution amended]. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Council of
Socialist Organisations </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>C5:  All

the start of the meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>C6: The purpose of

</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Appeals
Committee </span></b></p>

membership, who will have the right to attend the executive on a non-voting

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>The functions
of the committee shall be as follows:</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>i). Membership
- Where a local alliance or national body wishes to reject an application for
membership, or expel an existing member, the request must be made in writing to
the appeals committee, who will have the final decision.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>ii). Disputes -

or members platforms, or complaints about the conduct of individuals or members
platforms shall be referred to the appeals committee. The decision of the
committee will be binding on all parties concerned.</span></i></p>

are to be contested etc, the executive may ask the appeals committee to
investigate the situation and make recommendations for a course of action. The
final decision on these matters will remain with the executive.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>The expectation
is that all disputes should be resolved locally where possible, in line with
the SA’s principles of non-sectarian, positive cooperation. Disputes should
only be referred to the appeals committee where local attempts to find a
resolution have failed. All decisions of the appeals committee can be
overturned at a conference by a simple majority vote.</span></i></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>D: Local Socialist Alliances  </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>D1: Local and
regional organisation will have to be flexible to take account of the fact we
are a small but growing organisation and the fact that effective campaigning
and fighting different kinds of elections will require different organisational
forms. These local and regional Alliances must however demonstrate that they
comply with certain common criteria in order to be viable. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>(a) the Alliance has an organising group (or steering committee) with specific named
responsibilities (including treasurer and membership secretary).</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>(c) The Alliance maintains an up-to-date membership list and provides membership details to the
national organisation as required.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>D2: The
boundaries of a Socialist Alliance should in the first instance be a matter for
members to determine locally. If there is dispute over boundaries, this may be
referred to the National Executive with the right of appeal to Conference. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>D3: Local
Socialist Alliances should operate on similar principles to the National
Executive, trying to reach agreement where they can but deciding issues by
majority vote where they cannot.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>D5: Recognition
of local and regional Socialist Alliances as affiliates of the Socialist Alliance nationally will be determined by the National Executive, subject to review by the
National Conference.</span></i></p>

nationally.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>E2: Socialist Alliance candidates must be selected at properly notified meetings open to all Socialist Alliance members of the appropriate local organisation on the basis of one member, one
vote. If a Socialist Alliance does not exist in an area where someone wishes to
stand as a Socialist Alliance candidate, a local Socialist Alliance can be
established by the National Executive to carry out a selection process. The
national Nominating Officer should monitor the selection of candidates and
report regularly to the National Executive. In case of dispute or objection to
the selection of any Socialist Alliance candidate, confirmation of nomination
must be sought from the National Executive</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>E3: The  local
Socialist Alliance or  the National Executive, in consultation with one
another, may nominate the Socialist Alliance candidate to stand in a particular
election in exceptional circumstances. The final decision will lie with the
Nominating Officer who is accountable to the National Executive.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>E4: Socialist Alliance candidates will be expected to support the agreed policies of the Socialist Alliance and to promote the Socialist Alliance on public platforms. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>E5: Should
Socialist Alliance candidates be elected to office, they will be expected to
support Socialist Alliance national policy.</span></i></p>

the political and economic reorganisation of society on the basis of common
ownership &amp; control and production for need. It advocates the right of all
human beings to the basic necessities of civilised life, including peace, civil
liberty, food, water, education, health, housing, pensions in old age and
social welfare, in a genuinely democratic society free from racism and sexism.
The Alliance supports peace and justice both domestically and internationally.”</span></p>

regards global warming as a major threat to human civilisation and existence.
It sees capitalism – with its ruthless pursuit of short term profit and its
need for unending growth - as the major cause of environmental damage. It

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>a)“The Alliance is a campaigning
organisation. It also stands in elections where it has the support and means to
do so. The Alliance seeks to win support for its ideas and policies in the
socialist and environmental movements, the trade union movement and working
class communities. It is prepared to work in and with a broad range of socialist,
environmental and working class organisations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>b)The Alliance is not a party. It is not set up in opposition to other working class, socialist
or environmentalist groups and parties. The Alliance is an alliance, with
members from a range of other socialist and environmental parties and
organisations, whose prime loyalty may be to another such organisation. It does
expect Alliance members to act within their own organisations to promote common
aims and to consider affiliation to the Alliance.</span></p>

issues which cause the greatest day-to-day immiseration of the working class

grass-roots campaigns that have a democratic structure and transparent

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>RESOLUTION B to the SA Conference from Steve Freeman and
Dave Church</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>1.    This
conference supports the relaunch of the Socialist Alliance. We reject any
proposal to change the name of the Socialist Alliance for electoral or sectarian
reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We
recognise that the Socialist Alliance (1997-2005) was based on socialist unity
and not on adherence to any particular ideology or set of theories such as
Marxism, Leninism or Trotskyism. The SA was open and democratic, providing the
freedom for all socialists to promote their ideas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In
2001 the Socialist Alliance adopted the “People before Profit” programme. This
was not a revolutionary communist programme. It was a common programme for
socialist unity, around which socialists from a variety of traditions could
unite against Labour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We
recognise that the membership and leadership of the Socialist Alliance included
members of existing socialist groups/parties and independent socialists. We
recognise the SA was organised as a federal structure which continued in a
different form after 2001. This facilitated socialist unity with a wide degree
of openness and inclusivity.         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>2.             Since
2003 the launch of Respect the Unity Coalition and the departure of the SWP,
Workers Power and the ISG represented a major change for the Socialist
Alliance. Any new Socialist Alliance will now be a minority of socialists
outside the Labour Party. If a new SA is to succeed in building a real
influence in the working class it will need to sharpen its aims and adopt new
forms of organisation appropriate to the new situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>i)  The new SA
will make its priority campaigning activity rather than an almost exclusive
focus on elections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>ii) The new SA
will identify itself, where appropriate, as an alliance which promotes or
campaigns for republicanism, internationalism, socialism and the environment in
furtherance of the interests of the working class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>iii)  The new SA
will campaign for a republican socialist party along the lines of the Scottish
Socialist Party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>iv) The new SA
will continue to campaign for and promote non-sectarian co-operation between
socialist groups and individual socialists along with debate and constructive
criticism. To facilitate this, the new SA will adopt a new federal structure
based on a democratic and accountable membership organisation and a Council of
Socialist Organisations to encourage dialogue and promote co-operation between
the SA and its affiliates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left'>RESOLUTION D to the
Conference to Re-found the Socialist Alliance from Dave Spencer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>“This
conference resolves that the following principles should underpin the
refounding of a socialist alliance   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>i)
That ‘People Before Profit’ be adopted as the founding programme, but that it
be recognised that it requires substantial development, in dialogue with the
SA’s work within the working class struggle and that this development should
take place via the most thorough discussion and debate  and by resolution of
future SA conferences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>ii)
That, in its party building work, the SA will advocate the <b>organisational</b>
model of the Scottish Socialist Party. This is a unitary democratic, i.e.
non-federalist, party with full liberty of tendency, platform and faction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>iii)
This conference rejects any notion that the SSP should be our model for <b>political
</b>rather than organisational<b> </b>reasons, such as its position with regard
to republicanism. Moreover, we reject a strategy of pretending to be reformists
in the hope of winning a 'wider audience'. This would contradict the interests
of the working class. Our political model is a workers' party based on the
fundamentals of Marxism :-</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>(a) Only the self-emancipation of the
working class can lead to the emancipation of humanity and to a society of the
freely associated producers. Accordingly, we reject all strategies based on the
collaboration of antagonistically opposed classes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>RESOLUTION J</span></b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span><b><span lang=EN-GB>Three Resolutions on
Racism and Fascism, initially moved by Dave Landau</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>i)PRIOTISING
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM AND FASCISM</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>This conference
recognises that the struggle against racism and fascism should be a priority
for our work in the future on equal footing with Republicanism,
Internationalism, Socialism and the Environment and we will fight for it to be
a central plank in any future workers party.  Whilst conference recognises the
intimate relationship between this struggle and the other priorities we assert
the need to identify this priority specifically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>ii) <b><u>AGAINST
IMMIGRATION CONTROLS</u></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Conference notes
that immigration is a central issue in modern political discourse.  This
discourse is dominated by the forces of reaction attacking the working class
and the oppressed in two ways.  First as an attack migrants and refugees
themselves.  Secondly by dividing the working class ideologically and
economically. Conference notes the rise of parties across Europe whose central
feature is opposition to immigration – some of which are outright fascist
parties, some not. At the same time the mainstream parties adopt policies which
control the movements of people according to the needs of capital, opening and
closing doors to workers, using and disposing labour as they see fit, whilst
indulging in scapegoating migrants and refugees when it suites them to do so. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>We further note in
the UK the implementation of new legislation repressive legislation – for
example obliging local authorities to evict migrants and refugees, taking their
children into care rather than supporting a whole family. We are seeing
immigration controls merging with anti-terror legislation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Any organisation
arising out of this conference must make its stand with migrants and for
working class unity against these forces.  It is down to us to raise the banner
of opposition to immigration controls and proclaim that NO ONE IS ILLEGAL.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>In particular we
will fight for the following demands:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>NO DEPORTATIONS!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>NO DETENTIONS!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>EQUAL RIGHTS
POLITICALY, WELFARE AND AT WORK! In particular we will fight in the Trades
Unions for the organisations of all workers regardless of their immigration
status.  The way to protect the wages and conditions of all workers is to
ensure that no-one is left precarious and vulnerable to super-exploitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>DEFIANCE</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'> NOT COMPLIANCE! In particular we will
campaign in the Trades Unions for a policy of no-collaboration with the
repression of migrants and asylum seekers, refusing, for example, to implement
Section 9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act or the reporting of information to
the Home Office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>iii) <b><u>OPPOSING
THE BNP</u></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Conference notes
the gains that the British National Party (BNP) has made during the 21<sup>st</sup>
Century. Whilst only having a handful of council seats around the country, this
is far more than any fascist party has achieved in Britain in the past.  We are
in a critical period where if their fortunes are not reversed they might make a
breakthrough becoming a major party on political landscape.  The rest of Europe
shows that this is a real possibility – the Front National in France, Vlams Blok in Belgium, the Alliance Nazionale in Italy and the populist right-wing
anti-immigrant parties that have made gains elsewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Conference believes that there are two
limbs to the fight against fascism – building an anti-fascist united front
based on local grass-roots community/labour movement based campaigns and the
building of an alternative pole to those alienated and disempowered by the
mainstream politics; a workers party. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Both trades unions
and organisations of those under attack from fascism need to be central to
united front campaigns.  United front campaigns need to challenge all the lies
and myths of the fascists as well as those put out by the mainstream parties
and the gutter press.  They need to challenge racism and all other scapegoating
hate-mongering from all quarters.  A united front should say No Platform for
Fascists.  A united front should promote workers defence of communities under
attack from the fascists as well as supporting the right of community
self-defence.  Where possible a united front ought to present socialist alternatives
to the miserable conditions that often prevail in the areas the BNP target.  
Even where unity is not possible on these questions it is important that those
visibly promoting the united front campaigns are also those who have been
leading the struggles around such local questions.  We shall fight for these
principles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The establishment of Unite Against
Fascism (UAF) was a major step forward even though it fell far short of the
kind of united front that is needed.  Conference regrets the split between UAF
and Searchlight which was not around these principled questions.  We will
oppose the existence of rival local campaigns in the run up to the local
authority elections in May and will promote unity in action wherever possible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>AMMENDMENT
TO RESOLUTION J, initally moved by Dave Landau,</span><span lang=EN-GB> –
amendment <i>from Mike Davies</i></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>OPPOSING THE
BNP   </span></u><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Replace the
second paragraph with</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“Conference notes that mainstream parties
often give support to the politics of the BNP by advocating or introducing
racist measures against immigrants and refugees, by racist rhetoric and
otherwise promoting racism. It notes that this particularly applies to the
Conservative Party and the New Labour Party in Britain, who vie with each other
in being the more racist. Conference believes that opposition to the BNP must
not be based on explicitly or implicitly promoting support for mainstream
racist parties but on opposing the racism of both the BNP and those mainstream
parties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Conference therefore believes that a
primary way to oppose the BNP is to offer and promote a non-racist alternative.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Amongst wider
political issues, such an alternative should address the miserable conditions
that often prevail in the areas the BNP target areas and should seek to involve
any who have been leading the struggles around such local questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Conference
believes that ‘united front’ tactics are useful only in this context, as a way
of highlighting the unacceptability of racism and racist politics, whether on
the part of the BNP or on the part of mainstream parties. It opposes ‘united
front’ tactics which implicitly or explicitly promote the mainstream parties as
‘better than the BNP’. It believes that anti-BNP campaigns which do not offer a
genuine, non-racist alternative are likely to promote racist, discredited
mainstream parties and/or simply provide publicity for the BNP.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>And replace all
after “community self defence.” with:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>“Conference
supports such campaigns as United Against Fascism insofar these do not
explicitly or implicitly promote mainstream racist parties as alternatives to
the BNP. Conference looks for a united anti-racist campaign and deplores splits
which are not based on significant political differences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>Conference
resolves to </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>create or support
genuine, socialist, non-racist political alternatives to the racist BNP and
racist mainstream parties; work with and support communities and workers
threatened by racism.”</span></p>
