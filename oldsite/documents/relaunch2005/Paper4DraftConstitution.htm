  <p class="Section1"><b>SA(P) Officers final draft - Constitution of the Socialist <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Alliance [2005] </b></p>
  <h2 class="Section1">A: Statement of aims</h2>
  <p class="Section1">A1.  The name of the organisation will be “Socialist Alliance”.  </p>
  <p class="Section1">A2. The Socialist Alliance promotes the ideas and principles of democracy and republicanism, an environmentally sustainable global socialism and working class internationalism. The Socialist Alliance stands on the basis of the Socialist Alliance 2001 programme “People Before Profit”  </p>
  <p class="Section1">A3.  The Socialist Alliance aims to win support in the working class movement for a democratically organised republican socialist party, along the lines of the Scottish Socialist Party.  </p>
  <p class="Section1">A4.   Socialism  - The Socialist Alliance is opposed to capitalism and imperialism. Socialism abolishes capitalism and economic exploitation and hence the necessity for social oppression. Socialism re-organises society on the basis of common social ownership and democratic control. </p>
  <p class="Section1">A5.   Republicanism - The Socialist Alliance identifies the working class as the only genuinely democratic class in society. In the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region> the constitutional monarchist state is the main barrier to democracy and socialism. The struggle for democracy is the only road to working class self-emancipation. Our immediate political objective is to replace the constitutional monarchy with a democratic secular republic which includes the right of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Scotland</st1:country-region> and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Wales</st1:country-region> to self determination.   </p>
  <p class="Section1">A6.   Internationalism - The Socialist Alliance is internationalist in its outlook. International capitalism is creating an expanding working class across the world. Building international working class solidarity and co-operation is central to the struggle for democracy and socialism. We oppose all capitalist policies which divide the working class along national lines including imperialist wars and foreign occupations.</p>
  <p class="Section1">A7.  Environment –  The Socialist Alliance recognises the importance of the local and global environment on the lives of the world’s people, their health, safety and welfare. The greatest threat to the environment comes from the drive for corporate profits. The best defence of the social interest is in the democratic self organisation of the working class, full democratic rights, full freedom of information and scientific knowledge. Socialism will replace capitalism with social production organised on the basis of global social needs and world ecological sustainability. </p>
  <p class="Section1">A8. The Socialist Alliance is a campaigning organisation, seeking to win support for our ideas and policies in the socialist movement, the trade union movement and working class communities. We are prepared to work in and campaign within a broad range of socialist and working class organisations. We are prepared to stand in elections where circumstances indicate we have the support and means to do so.  </p>
  <p class="Section1">A9.  The Socialist Alliance is not a party. We are not set up in opposition to other working class groups and parties. We are an alliance. This means we have independent members and members from a range of socialist parties and organisations. We are not seeking to persuade members of other socialist organisations to leave their organisations. We expect comrades to act within their own organisations to promote our common aims and consider membership/affiliation to the SA. </p>
  <p class="Section1">A10.  The Socialist Alliance is a democratic organisation. We believe in openness of ideas and freedom of expression and believe this is the best method of building an effective campaigning organisation for a new workers party.</p>
  <h2 class="Section1">B: Membership  [<i>All subsequent words in italics are taken from the existing SA (2001) constitution.</i>]</h2>
  <p class="Section1">B1: Membership is open to all who broadly agree with the aims of the SA and accept its aims and programme as the basis for common activity.

  <p class="Section1">B7: <i> Membership of the <st1:City w:st="on">Alliance carries an obligation not to obstruct campaigns decided on by the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Alliance. We recognise, however, the right of minorities publicly to promote their views. In the event that an organised minority intends to take any action conflicting with a majority decision nationally or locally, that minority should inform the <st1:place
