  <h2>RESOLUTIONS TO BE DEBATED AT THE CONFERENCE TO RE-LAUNCH THE SOCIALIST ALLIANCE ON NOVEMBER 12</span></h2>
  <h3>RESOLUTION A on Personalised Insults, to be moved by Dave Spencer and Pete McLaren</span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
  <p>&quot;Personalised insults, baiting and shouting down of those comrades we do not agree with are unacceptable forms of behaviour within the Socialist Alliance at meetings or on email lists.  It is a democratic principle that comrades should be allowed to put their point of view and be listened to with respect.&quot;</span></p>
  <h3>RESOLUTION B to the SA Conference from Steve Freeman and Dave Church</span></h3>
  <p>1. This conference supports the relaunch of the Socialist Alliance. We reject any proposal to change the name of the Socialist Alliance for electoral or sectarian reasons.</span></p>
  <p>We recognise that the Socialist Alliance (1997-2005) was based on socialist unity and not on adherence to any particular ideology or set of theories such as Marxism, Leninism or Trotskyism. The SA was open and democratic, providing the freedom for all socialists to promote their ideas. </span></p>
  <p>In 2001 the Socialist Alliance adopted the “People before Profit” programme. This was not a revolutionary communist programme. It was a common programme for socialist unity, around which socialists from a variety of traditions could unite against Labour. </span></p>
  <p>We recognise that the membership and leadership of the Socialist Alliance included members of existing socialist groups/parties and independent socialists. We recognise the SA was organised as a federal structure which continued in a different form after 2001. This facilitated socialist unity with a wide degree of openness and inclusivity.         </span></p>
  <p>2. Since 2003 the launch of Respect the Unity Coalition and the departure of the SWP, Workers Power and the ISG represented a major change for the Socialist Alliance. Any new Socialist Alliance will now be a minority of socialists outside the Labour Party. If a new SA is to succeed in building a real influence in the working class it will need to sharpen its aims and adopt new forms of organisation appropriate to the new situation.</span></p>
  <p>i)  The new SA will make its priority campaigning activity rather than an almost exclusive focus on elections.</span></p>
  <p>ii) The new SA will identify itself, where appropriate, as an alliance which promotes or campaigns for republicanism, internationalism, socialism and the environment in furtherance of the interests of the working class.</span></p>
  <p>iii)  The new SA will campaign for a republican socialist party along the lines of the Scottish Socialist Party.</span></p>
  <p>iv) The new SA will continue to campaign for and promote non-sectarian co-operation between socialist groups and individual socialists along with debate and constructive criticism. To facilitate this, the new SA will adopt a new federal structure based on a democratic and accountable membership organisation and a Council of Socialist Organisations to encourage dialogue and promote co-operation between the SA and its affiliates. </span></p>
  <h3><b>RESOLUTION C</span></b> <b>from Terry Liddle </b></span></h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>This conference endorses the promotion of the SA an alliance for republicanism, internationalism, socialism and the environment. As a consequence the conference agrees that the acronym “ARISE” can be used in SA propaganda where it is appropriate.</span></p>
  <h3 class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left'>RESOLUTION D to the Conference to Re-found the Socialist Alliance from Dave Spencer</h3>
  <p>“This conference resolves that the following principles should underpin the refounding of a socialist alliance   </span></p>
  <p>i) That ‘People Before Profit’ be adopted as the founding programme, but that it be recognised that it requires substantial development, in dialogue with the SA’s work within the working class struggle and that this development should take place via the most thorough discussion and debate  and by resolution of future SA conferences.</span></p>
  <p>ii) That, in its party building work, the SA will advocate the <b>organisational</b> model of the Scottish Socialist Party. This is a unitary democratic, i.e. non-federalist, party with full liberty of tendency, platform and faction. </span></p>
  <p>iii) This conference rejects any notion that the SSP should be our model for <b>political </b>rather than organisational<b> </b>reasons, such as its position with regard to republicanism. Moreover, we reject a strategy of pretending to be reformists in the hope of winning a 'wider audience'. This would contradict the interests of the working class. Our political model is a workers' party based on the fundamentals of Marxism :-</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(a) Only the self-emancipation of the working class can lead to the emancipation of humanity and to a society of the freely associated producers. Accordingly, we reject all strategies based on the collaboration of antagonistically opposed classes.</span></p>
  <p>(b) The self-emancipation of the working class requires a political struggle for the fullest possible democracy *  against the capitalist state;</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times;color:black'>*  in the workers' movement, against the bureaucracy of the trade union officials and the bureaucratic centralism of the petty sects; and with a leadership accountable to its membership.</span></p>
  <p>iv) That the SA stands opposed to the bureaucratic centralism and sectarianism which has been endemic in so many left groups, (where sectarianism is defined as putting the interests of their own organisation above the interests of the working class).</span></p>
  <p>v) That the building and re-building of vibrant local SA branches should be an urgent priority.</span></p>
  <p>The mover will request that, although it is moved as a single motion, it be voted on numbered paragraph by numbered paragraph.</span></p>
  <h3>RESOLUTION E CPGB Motion 1: ‘Respect and the fight for a Marxist party’</span></h3>
  <p>1</span>. The Socialist Alliance (Provisional) commits itself to the fight for a Marxist party as an immediate priority.</span></p>
  <p>2. This struggle must be conducted in amongst the Marxists, the majority of whom are today organised in undemocratic sects. Clearly, the largest of these is the Socialist Workers Party.</span></p>
  <p>3. Comrades from the SA (P) must therefore prioritise engaging with SWP members. Concretely, this will mean work in Respect.</span></p>
  <p>4. SA (P) comrades will therefore cooperate with others to establish an organised Respect left.</span>  </span></p>
  <h3>RESOLUTION F CPGB Motion 2: ‘Halfway houses’</span></h3>
  <p>1. The Socialist Alliance (Provisional) believes that Marxists should not put the fight for their programme on ‘hold’ in order to deliberately create ‘halfway house’ political formations. </span></p>
  <p>2. There is no inevitable stage that imposes on us the need to create organisations such as the Scottish Socialist Party, the Socialist Alliance or some communist-Labour hybrid. </span></p>
  <p>3. We will engage with such organisations when and if they arise. However, Marxists recognise that the working class needs its own party, not one dominated by trends that are antagonistic to proletarian politics.</span></p>
  <p>4. A genuine working class party is a Marxist party; its scientifically correct name is a communist party.</span></p>
  <h3>RESOLUTION G</span> </span>Proposed Constitution of the Socialist Alliance [2005] – from the Officers of the SA (P), to be moved by Pete McLaren and Seconded by Steve Freeman </span></h3>
  <h3>A: Statement of aims</span></h3>
  <p>A1.  The name<b> </b>of the organisation will be “Socialist Alliance”.  </span></p>
  <p>A2. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>promotes the ideas and principles of democracy and republicanism, an environmentally sustainable global socialism and working class internationalism. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>stands on the basis of the Socialist Alliance 2001 programme “People Before Profit”  </span></p>
  <p>A3.  The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>aims to win support in the working class movement for a democratically organised republican socialist party, along the lines of the Scottish Socialist Party.  </span></p>
  <p>A4.   Socialism  - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is opposed to capitalism and imperialism. Socialism abolishes capitalism and economic exploitation and hence the necessity for social oppression. Socialism re-organises society on the basis of common social ownership and democratic control. </span></p>
  <p>A5.   Republicanism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>identifies the working class as the only genuinely democratic class in society. In the United Kingdom the constitutional monarchist state is the main barrier to democracy and socialism. The struggle for democracy is the only road to working class self-emancipation. Our immediate political objective is to replace the constitutional monarchy with a democratic secular republic which includes the right of Ireland, Scotland and Wales to self determination.   </span></p>
  <p>A6.   Internationalism - The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is internationalist in its outlook. International capitalism is creating an expanding working class across the world. Building international working class solidarity and co-operation is central to the struggle for democracy and socialism. We oppose all capitalist policies which divide the working class along national lines including imperialist wars and foreign occupations.</span></p>
  <p>A7.  Environment –  The Socialist Alliance recognises the importance of the local and global environment on the lives of the world’s people, their health, safety and welfare. The greatest threat to the environment comes from the drive for corporate profits. The best defence of the social interest is in the democratic self organisation of the working class, full democratic rights, full freedom of information and scientific knowledge. Socialism will replace capitalism with social production organised on the basis of global social needs and world ecological sustainability. </span></p>
  <p>A8. The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is a campaigning organisation, seeking to win support for our ideas and policies in the socialist movement, the trade union movement and working class communities. We are prepared to work in and campaign within a broad range of socialist and working class organisations. We are prepared to stand in elections where circumstances indicate we have the support and means to do so.  </span></p>
  <p>A9.  The Socialist Alliance is not a party. We are not set up in opposition to other working class groups and parties. We are an alliance. This means we have independent members and members from a range of socialist parties and organisations. We are not seeking to persuade members of other socialist organisations to leave their organisations. We expect comrades to act within their own organisations to promote our common aims and consider membership/affiliation to the SA. </span></p>
  <p>A10.  The Socialist Alliance<b> </b>is a democratic organisation. We believe in openness of ideas and freedom of expression and believe this is the best method of building an effective campaigning organisation for a new workers party.</span></p>
  <h3>B: Membership  [<i>All subsequent words in italics are taken from the existing SA (2001) constitution.</i>]</span></h3>
  <p>B1: Membership is open to all who broadly agree with the aims of the SA and accept its aims and programme as the basis for common activity.<b><span style='color:black'> </span></b><span

  <p>B2:  A member must pay the appropriate subscription to the Socialist Alliance. Local branches may seek additional donations from their own members as decided locally.</span></p>
  <p>B3.  <i>Members of other parties, organisations and groups who join the Socialist Alliance are expected to be able to keep their identity as members of these organisations whilst participating fully within the development of the Socialist Alliance.</i></span></p>
  <p><i>B4: Individual members are thus welcome from other groups and organisations and membership of these should be declared on application/renewal of membership of the Socialist Alliance.</span></i></p>
  <p>B5<i>: The annual fee for individual membership will be determined by the Annual Conference of the Socialist Alliance. </i>Where ever possible members will be allocated to the nearest local branch. Where this is not practical members will remain national members.<i> Membership is on the basis of membership of only one local Socialist Alliance at any time. </i></span></p>
  <p>B6:  Socialist and working class organisations can support the Socialist Alliance by paying an affiliation fee. Affiliates are encouraged to publicise SA activities and consult and co-operate with the SA wherever possible.</span></p>
  <p>B7: <i> Membership of the Alliance carries an obligation not to obstruct campaigns decided on by the Alliance. We recognise, however, the right of minorities publicly to promote their views. In the event that an organised minority intends to take any action conflicting with a majority decision nationally or locally, that minority should inform the Alliance at the relevant level of its intention to do so.</i></span></p>
  <h3>C: National policy-making and structures</span></h3>

  <p>C6: The purpose of the Council is to assist in securing the maximum unity in action and closest co-operation between the SA and its affiliates. The Council seeks to encourage constructive dialogue and non-sectarian but critical exchange of views amongst affiliates themselves. </span></p>
  <p>C7: The Council can take majority decisions, but these are not binding either on affiliated organisations or on the Socialist Alliance. These decisions are to be reported back to delegating bodies as recommendations. These may then become the basis for joint action involving the SA and some or all of its affiliates.       </span></p>
  <p><b>Election and powers of the National Executive </span></b></p>
  <p>C8<i>: </i>A 12 person<i> National Executive will be elected at the Annual Conference. </i>Comrades seeking nomination will include their political affiliation (see clause B4) with their nomination.

  <p><i>C13: The National Executive will have the power to disaffiliate local Socialist Alliances and remove individual membership or refuse to ratify candidate selection if it is concluded that the basic statement of aims has been breached by a Socialist Alliance, by an individual member or by a candidate.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>C14: Decisions of the National Executive relating to affiliation of local organisations or ratification of candidates can be appealed to the Annual Conference. The Annual Conference has the final authority to decide all issues relating to the Socialist Alliance.</span></i></p>

  <p><i>C16: The constitution of the Socialist Alliance may be changed by resolution of the Annual Conference or by resolution of a Special Meeting open to all members called by the National Executive, or by request of 25 percent of the membership of the Socialist Alliance, provided such resolution receives a simple majority. </span></i></p>
  <p><b>Appeals Committee </span></b></p>
  <p><i>C17: Conference will elect an Appeals Committee with a membership of three, who must not be members of the executive. The committee shall elect a convenor from amongst its membership, who will have the right to attend the executive on a non-voting basis.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>The functions of the committee shall be as follows:</span></i></p>
  <p><i>i). Membership - Where a local alliance or national body wishes to reject an application for membership, or expel an existing member, the request must be made in writing to the appeals committee, who will have the final decision.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>ii). Disputes - Any disputes about the balance of rights and duties between individual members or members platforms, or complaints about the conduct of individuals or members platforms shall be referred to the appeals committee. The decision of the committee will be binding on all parties concerned.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>iii). Elections - Where disputes arise locally around endorsement of candidates, which seats are to be contested etc, the executive may ask the appeals committee to investigate the situation and make recommendations for a course of action. The final decision on these matters will remain with the executive.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>The expectation is that all disputes should be resolved locally where possible, in line with the SA’s principles of non-sectarian, positive cooperation. Disputes should only be referred to the appeals committee where local attempts to find a resolution have failed. All decisions of the appeals committee can be overturned at a conference by a simple majority vote.</span></i></p>
  <h3>D: Local Socialist Alliances  </span></h3>
  <p><i>D1: Local and regional organisation will have to be flexible to take account of the fact we are a small but growing organisation and the fact that effective campaigning and fighting different kinds of elections will require different organisational forms. These local and regional Alliances must however demonstrate that they comply with certain common criteria in order to be viable. </span></i></p>
  <p><i>(a) the Alliance has an organising group (or steering committee) with specific named responsibilities (including treasurer and membership secretary).</span></i></p>
  <p><i>(b) the Alliance has a regular meeting, publicly advertised, open to all members (and potential new members).</span></i></p>
  <p><i>(c) The Alliance maintains an up-to-date membership list and provides membership details to the national organisation as required.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>D2: The boundaries of a Socialist Alliance should in the first instance be a matter for members to determine locally. If there is dispute over boundaries, this may be referred to the National Executive with the right of appeal to Conference. </span></i></p>
  <p><i>D3: Local Socialist Alliances should operate on similar principles to the National Executive, trying to reach agreement where they can but deciding issues by majority vote where they cannot.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>D5: Recognition of local and regional Socialist Alliances as affiliates of the Socialist Alliance nationally will be determined by the National Executive, subject to review by the National Conference.</span></i></p>
  <h3>E: Selection of candidates</span></h3>
  <p><i>E1: The local Socialist Alliance will have the responsibility for all elections contested by the Socialist Alliance within its area  and for all arrangements regarding local candidate, agent, treasurer, in line with Socialist Alliance requirements nationally.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>E2: Socialist Alliance candidates must be selected at properly notified meetings open to all Socialist Alliance members of the appropriate local organisation on the basis of one member, one vote. If a Socialist Alliance does not exist in an area where someone wishes to stand as a Socialist Alliance candidate, a local Socialist Alliance can be established by the National Executive to carry out a selection process. The national Nominating Officer should monitor the selection of candidates and report regularly to the National Executive. In case of dispute or objection to the selection of any Socialist Alliance candidate, confirmation of nomination must be sought from the National Executive</span></i></p>
  <p><i>E3: The  local Socialist Alliance or  the National Executive, in consultation with one another, may nominate the Socialist Alliance candidate to stand in a particular election in exceptional circumstances. The final decision will lie with the Nominating Officer who is accountable to the National Executive.</span></i></p>
  <p><i>E4: Socialist Alliance candidates will be expected to support the agreed policies of the Socialist Alliance and to promote the Socialist Alliance on public platforms. </span></i></p>
  <p><i>E5: Should Socialist Alliance candidates be elected to office, they will be expected to support Socialist Alliance national policy.</span></i></p>

  <h3><b>RESOLUTION H - DSA resolution on a Constitution for the SA, to be moved by John Pearson</span></b></h3>
  <p>“This Conference resolves to adopt the constitution of the Socialist Alliance, as at 5 February  2005, incorporating the following immediate amendments :-</span></p>
  <p>a) the replacement of all references to &quot;Socialist Alliance&quot; by &quot;Democratic Socialist Alliance&quot;.</span></p>
  <p>b) the deletion of 'in England' in the first sentence of clause A1.</span></p>
  <p>c) after 'Our intention is to do this by establishing' in clause A4, delete the words 'a broad organisation' and substitute 'a new working class political party'.</span></p>
  <p>d) the replacement of 'broad based political' in the first sentence of clause A7 by 'working class socialist party as an'.</span></p>
  <p>e) after 'The National Executive will be elected at the Annual Conference' in clause C4, delete 'Nominations to the executive must be by slate drawn up and presented to conference. Election will be by alternative vote*' and after 'The number of members of the National Executive will be determined by the Annual Conference', delete also the footnote , '*The Alternative Vote system means voting will be by indicating the order of preference between the slates presented for election. If no slate has an absolute majority of the votes cast, the slate with least votes will be eliminated and those votes redistributed according to the next preference. The process of elimination and redistribution will continue until one slate does have an absolute majority', replacing with, 'As an interim measure pending adoption of a permanent system of election at a future conference, the executive committee will be elected by individual ballot'.</span></p>
  <p>This Conference notes that the constitution incorporating these amendments is set out in Appendix A to this resolution”.</span></p>
  <h3>Appendix A</span></h3>
  <h3>A: Statement of aims</h3>
  <p>A1: The Democratic Socialist Alliance is working towards a fair and truly sustainable society. The transition to such a society will require fundamental social, economic, political and cultural changes, which will only be possible through the involvement of a clear majority of people. It is essential to pursue change through a variety of avenues in the community, in the workplace, in elections, through appropriate educational and campaigning efforts according to the opportunities and expediencies of the time and the place. We therefore aspire to offer organisation, facilitation and encouragement, as appropriate, to whatever efforts and developments are contributing to this process of change. We will also provide political support and solidarity to those who are involved in fighting back against environmental destruction and all other injustices of capitalism, here and across the world.</span></p>
  <p>A2: This is because we believe that there is an alternative to the global, unregulated free market and that the wealth exists in society to meet people's needs. We aim to galvanise mass opposition to the injustice, inequality and environmental damage which the market causes and to replace it with a popular socialist republic, based on democratic common ownership and democratic control of the key sectors of the economy, a system based on social justice and ecological sustainability.</span></p>
  <p>A3: We recognise that the current Labour leadership has dismantled whatever aspiration to socialism the Party ever had. It has embraced the free market and removed all methods of reversing this new direction from within the Party. In its failure to challenge current conservative free market ideology, Labour encourages a climate where far right and fascist views may fill the vacuum.</span></p>
  <p>A4: Opposition to this must therefore come from developing policies, campaigns and political representation which engages socialists with the environmental, direct action, anti-racist and industrial struggles, working together in genuinely new ways to put forward the alternative to New Labour and its partnership with multi-national business and media tycoons. Our intention is to do this by establishing a new working class political party, through the Democratic Socialist Alliance, based on accepted principles and open to all individuals and organisations who support these and who agree to join in working together in non-sectarian, co-operative and positive ways.</span></p>
  <p>A5: Our overall aim is actively to help create a socially just and ecologically sustainable society. This is one in which social justice is defined as incorporating: <br>
    * the political organisation of society in the most open, democratic, participative and accountable manner practicable; <br>
    * the maximum freedom of the individual commensurate with the freedom of others; <br>
    * the fight against and ultimate abolition of sexism, racism, homophobia, discrimination against people with disabilities and on grounds of age; <br>
    * the ultimate abolition of all forms of economic exploitation and social oppression, in such ways as to secure for the people the full return of all wealth generated by industries and services of society, by means of common ownership and democratic control; <br>
    * the promotion of peace, nationally and internationally, and of a system of justice which gives defence from tyranny, prejudice and the abuse of power, and in which ecological sustainability is incorporated; <br>
    * the promotion of only those social, economic and cultural structures which may be sustained indefinitely without causing any form of irreversible damage to the global ecosystem; <br>
    * the guaranteeing and, where necessary, restoration of such biological diversity as is essential to the viability of both global and local ecosystems.</span></p>
  <p>A6: To achieve our ultimate aim, bearing in mind the prevailing political, economic and social conditions, imperatives and opportunities of any given time and location, we shall from time to time develop strategic and tactical objectives. These will be: <br>
    * attainable goals valuable in themselves <br>
    * stages towards greater change <br>
    * catalysts for the wider propagation and discussion of information, ideas and action commensurate with our aim. <br>
    In pursuit of our aim, or of any strategic or tactical objective conducive to this, we may assist, encourage, enjoin or affiliate with any local, national or international organisations.</span></p>
  <p>A7: The aim of the Democratic Socialist Alliance is to build a working class socialist party as an alternative to New Labour. We seek to do this by building the Democratic Socialist Alliance as a campaigning organisation at both national and local level, supporting workers in struggle, initiating and supporting progressive campaigns, working in the unions to strengthen the left and build for a fight-back, and by fighting on a socialist platform in elections. We want to build local Alliances which are rooted in local campaigns and the local labour movement. The manifesto, People Before Profit, constitutes the current agreed platform of the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>A8: We intend to develop as an organisation which recognises the variety of views held by the many different perspectives within the Democratic Socialist Alliance; indeed we see this as a strength. We have agreed to unite and campaign around the policies we can all accept.</span></p>
  <p>A9: The Democratic Socialist Alliance at all levels should be representative of the gender, ethnic minority and age balance in the population, amongst our voters and membership. We also recognise the desirability of balance and inclusiveness for political trends within the Democratic Socialist Alliance at all levels of the organisation. All local Democratic Socialist Alliances as well as individual members attending national conferences are encouraged to take this into account in electing officers, steering committees and selecting candidates.</span></p>
  <h3>B: Membership</h3>
  <p>B1: Any individual who broadly agrees with the aims of the Democratic Socialist Alliance and agrees to abide by the structure and the anti-sectarian, co-operative and positive way of working which are involved in it may join the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>B2: The Democratic Socialist Alliance is a broad, open, inclusive and flexible organisation, based on voluntary participation. The Democratic Socialist Alliance is politically pluralistic and encourages all individuals and perspectives to participate fully in our vision of a socialist society and our way of working as an alliance. Members of other parties, organisations and groups who join the Democratic Socialist Alliance are expected to be able to keep their identity as members of these organisations whilst participating fully within the development of the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>B3: To further this, membership of the Democratic Socialist Alliance assumes a political and financial commitment. It also assumes a commitment to the anti-sectarian and co-operative way of working, looking to build unity rather than set out a position to create discord, positively supporting and encouraging the notion of alliances and ensuring that any critical debates are conducted in a positive manner and without personal attacks. All members should be paid up to the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>B4: Individual members are thus welcome from other groups and organisations and membership of these should be declared on application/renewal of membership of the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>B5: There will be a unified individual membership of the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The annual fee for individual membership will be determined by the Annual Conference of the Democratic Socialist Alliance, including the division of the membership fee between national and local organisations. Normally an individual will join the local Democratic Socialist Alliance nearest to where they live, work or study, and pay their subscription to this Democratic Socialist Alliance. Membership is on the basis of membership of only one local Democratic Socialist Alliance at any time. Membership entitles members to participation as appropriate at all levels of the Democratic Socialist Alliance. If there is no appropriate local Democratic Socialist Alliance, membership will be of the national organisation alone, to which the membership fee will be paid directly.</span></p>
  <p>B6: Affiliation of local and regional Democratic Socialist Alliances will be based on an affiliation fee to be determined by the Annual Conference, and will require that membership lists are passed on to the national organisation to compile a national membership list. Other forms of affiliation and affiliation fees will also be determined by the Annual Conference</span></p>
  <h3>C: National  policy-making and structure</h3>
  <p>C1: National policy will be decided democratically by an Annual Conference, open to all members.</span></p>
  <p>C2: There will be political meetings and conferences of the Democratic Socialist Alliance in addition to the Annual Conference, open to all members to attend, at the discretion of the National Executive or National Council or on the basis of a request from 25 percent of the membership. Such conferences may alter the policy and constitution of the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>C3: The implementation of national policy and national activities between Conferences, and the organisation of the Annual and any other Conferences, will be carried out by the National Executive, which will be elected at the Annual Conference.</span></p>
  <p>C4: The National Executive will be elected at the Annual Conference. The number of members of the National Executive will be determined by the Annual Conference. As an interim measure pending adoption of a permanent system of election at a future conference, the executive committee will be elected by individual ballot.</span></p>
  <p>C5: The National Executive will appoint officers from amongst the Executive at its discretion to take on particular responsibilities. These will include six named officers (chair/'leader', nominating officer, treasurer, membership secretary and secretary) and should also include a youth officer, a black officer, a women's officer, a trade union officer and officers responsible for developing Democratic Socialist Alliances locally and regionally, e.g. convening meetings of members in the regions, informing local Democratic Socialist Alliances of developments, supporting Alliances in setting up and ensuring liaison between local, regional and national levels of the organisation. Officers may be replaced by simple majority vote of the Executive and officer posts, with the exception of the named officer posts, may be changed at the discretion of the National Executive.</span></p>
  <p>C6: The National Officers will be accountable to the National Executive, the National Council and the Annual Conference. The National Executive will be accountable to the National Council and the Annual Conference of the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The National Officers and Executive are obliged to carry out the decisions of the Annual Conference and the National Council.</span></p>
  <p>C7: The National Executive may co-opt additional members to the Executive by vote of two thirds majority of the Executive. The National Executive will appoint spokespersons on all the major aspects of policy to communicate with the media and also to develop policy and action in these areas (eg employment, environment, women, racism). The spokespersons are accountable to, and subject to recall by the National Executive, Conference and other national elected bodies. To develop policy and action in their subject the spokespersons, will be able to call meetings of interested members, taking into account regional and access needs.</span></p>
  <p>C8: The National Executive will meet monthly. Individual non-executive members may attend such meetings by invitation of the National Executive. The National Executive will endeavour to decide issues wherever possible by agreement but where no agreement is possible decisions will be made by majority vote.</span></p>
  <p>C9: The National Council will consist of the members of the Executive and one delegate from each of the affiliated local and regional Democratic Socialist Alliances.</span></p>
  <p>C10: The National Council will meet quarterly or more frequently at the discretion of the National Executive.</span></p>
  <p>C11: The National Council will be able to determine policy at their meetings by simple majority vote.</span></p>
  <p>C12: The National Executive and the National Council will be responsible for the running of the national organisation, for finance, membership, arrangements of national meetings, communications with local groups and individuals, national bulletin production and distribution, liaison with other groups and organisations, arrangements for seeking and enabling electoral unity; and any other matters delegated to them by the Annual Conference.</span></p>
  <p>C13: The National Executive will have the power to disaffiliate local Democratic Socialist Alliances and remove individual membership or refuse to ratify candidate selection if it is concluded that the basic statement of aims has been breached by a Democratic Socialist Alliance, by an individual member or by a candidate.</span></p>
  <p>C14: Decisions of the National Executive relating to affiliation of local organisations or ratification of candidates can be appealed to the National Council and such decisions of the National Council can be appealed to the Annual Conference. The Annual Conference has the final authority to decide all issues relating to the Democratic Socialist Alliance.</span></p>
  <p>C15: The Democratic Socialist Alliance may be dissolved by a resolution of a Special Meeting, called for this purpose by the National Executive or the National Council or by request of 25 percent of the membership. Any assets of the Democratic Socialist Alliance shall be distributed to any organisation or organisations having aims consistent with those of the Democratic Socialist Alliance, as agreed at such a Special Meeting.</span></p>
  <p>C16: The constitution of the Democratic Socialist Alliance may be changed by resolution of the Annual Conference or by resolution of a Special Meeting open to all members called by the National Executive, National Council or by request of 25 percent of the membership of the Democratic Socialist Alliance, provided such resolution receives a simple majority.</span></p>
  <p>C17:Conference will elect an Appeals Committee with a membership of five, who must not be members of the executive. The committee shall elect a convenor from amongst its membership, who will have the right to attend the executive on a non-voting basis. <br>
    The functions of the committee shall be as follows: <br>
    1. Membership - Where a local alliance or national body wishes to reject an application for membership, or expel an existing member, the request must be made in writing to the appeals committee, who will have the final decision. <br>
    2. Disputes - Any disputes about the balance of rights and duties between individual members or members platforms, or complaints about the conduct of individuals or members platforms shall be referred to the appeals committee. The decision of the committee will be binding on all parties concerned. <br>
    3. Elections - Where disputes arise locally around endorsement of candidates, which seats are to be contested etc, the executive may ask the appeals committee to investigate the situation and make recommendations for a course of action. </span></p>
  <p>The final decision on these matters will remain with the executive. <br>
    The expectation is that all disputes should be resolved locally where possible, in line with the SA's principles of non-sectarian, positive cooperation. Disputes should only be referred to the appeals committee where local attempts to find a resolution have failed. All decisions of the appeals committee can be overturned at a conference by a simple majority vote.</span></p>
  <p>C18: Membership of the Alliance carries an obligation not to obstruct campaigns decided on by the Alliance. We recognise, however, the right of minorities publicly to promote their views. In the event that an organised minority intends to take any action conflicting with a majority decision nationally or locally, that minority should inform the Alliance at the relevant level of its intention to do so.</span></p>
  <h3>D: Local and regional organisation</h3>
  <p>D1: Local and regional organisation will have to be flexible to take account of the fact we are a small but growing organisation and the fact that effective campaigning and fighting different kinds of elections will require different organisational forms. These local and regional Democratic Socialist Alliances must however demonstrate that they comply with certain common criteria in order to be viable (to be further developed by the Executive during 2001-2002 for presentation to the 2002 AGM): <br>
    (a) the Alliance has an organising group (or steering committee) with specific named responsibilities (including treasurer and membership secretary). <br>
    (b) the Alliance has a regular meeting, publicly advertised, open to all members (and potential new members). <br>
    (c) The Alliance maintains an up-to-date membership list and provides membership details to the national organisation as required.</span></p>
  <p>D2: The boundaries of a Democratic Socialist Alliance should in the first instance be a matter for members to determine locally. If there is dispute over boundaries, this may be referred to regional body for resolution and the relevant regional officer on the National Executive if appropriate or, if this is not feasible or successful, to the National Executive as a whole, with the right of appeal to the National Council and then to Conference.</span></p>
  <p>D3: Local Democratic Socialist Alliances should operate on similar principles to the National Executive, trying to reach agreement where they can but deciding issues by majority vote where they cannot.</span></p>
  <p>D4: To help co-ordinate and facilitate the campaigning and election work of local Democratic Socialist Alliances, it may be appropriate to establish a regional level of structure. The structure of such a regional body should be established at an open meeting for all members of the Democratic Socialist Alliance in that region, in consultation with the relevant regional officer, as appropriate, of the National Executive or, if not, with the National Executive as a whole.</span></p>
  <p>D5: Recognition of local and regional Democratic Socialist Alliances as affiliates of the Democratic Socialist Alliance nationally will be determined by the National Executive, subject to review by the National Council and Conference.</span></p>
  <h3><b>E: Selection of candidates</span></b></h3>
  <p>E1: The local Democratic Socialist Alliance will have the responsibility for all elections contested by the Democratic Socialist Alliance within its area (eg council, Westminster etc) and for all arrangements regarding local candidate, agent, treasurer, in line with Democratic Socialist Alliance requirements nationally.</span></p>
  <p>E2: Democratic Socialist Alliance candidates must be selected at properly notified meetings open to all Democratic Socialist Alliance members of the appropriate local or regional organisation on the basis of one member, one vote. If a Democratic Socialist Alliance does not exist in an area where someone wishes to stand as a Democratic Socialist Alliance candidate, a local Democratic Socialist Alliance can be established by the relevant regional body or by the National Executive to carry out a selection process. The national Nominating Officer should monitor the selection of candidates and report regularly to the National Executive. In case of dispute or objection to the selection of any Democratic Socialist Alliance candidate, confirmation of nomination must be sought from the National Executive</span></p>
  <p>E3: The steering committee of the local Democratic Socialist Alliance or a relevant regional body or the National Executive, in consultation with one another, may nominate the Democratic Socialist Alliance candidate to stand in a particular election in exceptional circumstances. The final decision will lie with the Nominating Officer who is accountable to the National Executive.</span></p>
  <p>E4: Democratic Socialist Alliance candidates will be expected to support the agreed policies of the Democratic Socialist Alliance and to promote the Democratic Socialist Alliance on public platforms.</span></p>
  <p>E5: Should Democratic Socialist Alliance candidates be elected to office, they will be expected to support Democratic Socialist Alliance national policy.</span></p>

  <h3>RESOLUTION I from John Manley</span></h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>a) When the new name of the SA (P) is decided, a logo should be used by all members of the group on their letter headings, banners etc</span></p>
  <p>b) A ‘Socialist Affairs Committee’ should be formed to decide the issues that we should use for propaganda in current events eg with the police shooting, no one has been charged for manslaughter or death in police custody</span></p>
  <p>c) There should be a Socialist International Committee to make contact with other socialist groups throughout the world</span></p>
  <p><b>RESOLUTION J</span></b> </span><b>Three Resolutions on Racism and Fascism from Dave Landau</span></b></p>
  <p><b><u>i)PRIOTISING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM AND FASCISM</span></u></b></p>
  <p>This conference recognises that the struggle against racism and fascism should be a priority for our work in the future on equal footing with Republicanism, Internationalism, Socialism and the Environment and we will fight for it to be a central plank in any future workers party.  Whilst conference recognises the intimate relationship between this struggle and the other priorities we assert the need to identify this priority specifically.</span></p>
  <p>ii) <b><u>AGAINST IMMIGRATION CONTROLS</u></b></span></p>
  <p>Conference notes that immigration is a central issue in modern political discourse.  This discourse is dominated by the forces of reaction attacking the working class and the oppressed in two ways.  First as an attack migrants and refugees themselves.  Secondly by dividing the working class ideologically and economically. Conference notes the rise of parties across Europe whose central feature is opposition to immigration – some of which are outright fascist parties, some not. At the same time the mainstream parties adopt policies which control the movements of people according to the needs of capital, opening and closing doors to workers, using and disposing labour as they see fit, whilst indulging in scapegoating migrants and refugees when it suites them to do so. </span></p>
  <p>We further note in the UK the implementation of new legislation repressive legislation – for example obliging local authorities to evict migrants and refugees, taking their children into care rather than supporting a whole family. We are seeing immigration controls merging with anti-terror legislation.</span></p>
  <p>Any organisation arising out of this conference must make its stand with migrants and for working class unity against these forces.  It is down to us to raise the banner of opposition to immigration controls and proclaim that NO ONE IS ILLEGAL.  In particular we will fight for the following demands:</span></p>
  <p>NO DEPORTATIONS!</span></p>
  <p>NO DETENTIONS!</span></p>
  <p>EQUAL RIGHTS POLITICALY, WELFARE AND AT WORK! In particular we will fight in the Trades Unions for the organisations of all workers regardless of their immigration status.  The way to protect the wages and conditions of all workers is to ensure that no-one is left precarious and vulnerable to super-exploitation.</span></p>
  <p>DEFIANCE NOT COMPLIANCE! In particular we will campaign in the Trades Unions for a policy of no-collaboration with the repression of migrants and asylum seekers, refusing, for example, to implement Section 9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act or the reporting of information to the Home Office.</span></p>
  <p>iii) <b><u>OPPOSING THE BNP</u></b></span></p>
  <p>Conference notes the gains that the British National Party (BNP) has made during the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. Whilst only having a handful of council seats around the country, this is far more than any fascist party has achieved in Britain in the past.  We are in a critical period where if their fortunes are not reversed they might make a breakthrough becoming a major party on political landscape.  The rest of Europe shows that this is a real possibility – the Front National in France, Vlams Blok in Belgium, the Alliance Nazionale in Italy and the populist right-wing anti-immigrant parties that have made gains elsewhere.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Conference believes that there are two limbs to the fight against fascism – building an anti-fascist united front based on local grass-roots community/labour movement based campaigns and the building of an alternative pole to those alienated and disempowered by the mainstream politics; a workers party. </span></p>
  <p>Both trades unions and organisations of those under attack from fascism need to be central to united front campaigns.  United front campaigns need to challenge all the lies and myths of the fascists as well as those put out by the mainstream parties and the gutter press.  They need to challenge racism and all other scapegoating hate-mongering from all quarters.  A united front should say No Platform for Fascists.  A united front should promote workers defence of communities under attack from the fascists as well as supporting the right of community self-defence.  Where possible a united front ought to present socialist alternatives to the miserable conditions that often prevail in the areas the BNP target.   Even where unity is not possible on these questions it is important that those visibly promoting the united front campaigns are also those who have been leading the struggles around such local questions.  We shall fight for these principles.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The establishment of Unite Against Fascism (UAF) was a major step forward even though it fell far short of the kind of united front that is needed.  Conference regrets the split between UAF and Searchlight which was not around these principled questions.  We will oppose the existence of rival local campaigns in the run up to the local authority elections in May and will promote unity in action wherever possible. </span></p>
