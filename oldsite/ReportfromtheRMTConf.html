<H1 CLASS="western">REPORT FROM THE  RMT CONFERENCE  JAN 21 2006</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Conference began
promptly at 12 midday, with 350 people crammed into a rather small
hall, and a further 100 locked outside<B>.  </B>As a result, we could
not do much leafleting before conference,instead giving out both SA
leaflets at the end of the conference. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All the speakers on the
platform denounced the Labour Party for turning so far to the right. 
RMT Secretary Bob Crow set things off by saying &ldquo;We need a
debate&rdquo;.   He <FONT COLOR="#000000">said that anyone who
thought that</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">New
Labour could be reclaimed should explain how.  </FONT>Although he
reminded comrades this was not a conference to start a new party, and
said that the issue of working class representation was wider than
just the party question, he called for a new national shop stewards
movement and stated that he did not believe the Labour Party could be
reclaimed.  He asked what the new strategy should be, and asked where
the other trade union leaders were politically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This sort of anti
Labour view was echoed by other speakers.  Colin Fox from the SSP
described how they were fighting Labour in Scotland to abolish
prescription charges, re-introduce free school meals and replace the
council tax with a local income tax.  The working class were turning
away from Labour, hence the need for a new left party south of the
border.  The SSP would continue working with Respect and the
Socialist Alliance in the meantime.  The Chair of the Labour
Representation Committee, John McDonnell MP, argued that there were
real opportunities today to rebuild the left, building on the massive
protests against globilisation. The left was establishing itself in
the trade unions.  There was a strong potential for a united front on
specific issues which could then be linked.  The left needed to work
together in non sectarian ways.  New organisational forms will emerge
from the struggle, he concluded, without actually calling for the
formation of a new party.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Former Labour MP and
Socialist councillor Dave Nellist clearly did the make the call for a
new Workers&rsquo; Party, and announced that the SP would be calling
a follow up conference on March 19<SUP>th</SUP> at ULU in London as
party of their campaign for a new Workers&rsquo; Party.  He spoke
about the massive inequalities in society and described how a new
left party would challenge that.  The party must be open, democratic
and socialist, committed to ending the occupation of Iraq and
overturning privatisation, as well promoting wealth redistribution. 
A theme could be Public Funding of Public Services under Public
Control.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Green Party MEP Jean
Lambert understood why the left needed a new party.  She called for
reform of the electoral system to enable more greens and socialists
to be elected, as had happened in Scotland and Europe.  She also
argued that action outside of parliament was just as important, and
she called on trade unions to work with both Green and Left MPs and
councillors.  The final speaker, Liz Green from the SLP spoke of the
need to be positive rather than just attacking Labour.  She argued
that the SLP was broad and socialist, but members were unfairly
labelled as pariahs by both the right and the left.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following points
were made from the floor:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is a serious
	need to avoid electoral clashes</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Labour&rsquo;s
	move to the right makes the formation of a new left party that much
	more urgent</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today&rsquo;s
	meeting should be the start of the process of building a new party</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We have a wealth
	of experience between us</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The SSP began as
	the SSA &ndash; a new Party can not simply be declared</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We need a further
	meeting to push forward the idea of a new party, and this process
	should involve the Socialist Alliance and Respect</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Respect has come
	from nowhere to demonstrate the potential that exists for left
	success</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A central theme
	for any new party must be accountability</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Trade Unions must
	be represented at the heart of any new political project</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Chair informed the
Conference that the RMT Executive will receive a full report of the
Conference and then decide on the next step</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times">SOCIALIST PARTY FRINGE MEETING</FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Over 100 of those at
the RMT Conference stayed in the building for a further two hours for
the SP Fringe Meeting, chaired by Dave Nellist.  The Meeting was
addressed by UNISON&rsquo;s Roger Bannister, Mick Barry, SP
Councillor from Ireland, and SP NEC Member Hannah Sell.  The main
purpose of the meeting was for the SP to outline their Campaign for a
New Workers&rsquo; Party.  Dave Nellist made it clear that the
Conference which had been called to progress the Campaign for March
19<SUP>th</SUP> at ULU would be open and democratic. A Campaign
Committee would be elected to pursue the project.  It was also made
clear that, although the SP was keen to recruit and build the SP, the
New Workers&rsquo; Party needed to go well beyond the ranks of the
SP.  When Peter Taffe spoke from the floor, he echoed Hannah Sell&rsquo;s
call for the new Party to be federal in structure to encourage groups
to retain their identity whilst becoming part of the new project. 
Other speakers from the floor included Steve Freeman, who spoke on
behalf of the Socialist Alliance.  He reminded the audience that many
of them including Dave Nellist had been members of the SA.  The new
SA was promoting the traditional SA policy of socialist unity and
co-operation between socialist organisations, and was also taking up
the party question. The SP&rsquo;s Clive Heemskirk had already been
to the Council of Socialist Organisations to speak about the SP
campaign and it was to be recommended to the SA executive that we
affiliate. There was already much interest within the SA for a new
type of party.  Steve concluded by pointing to a dangerous crisis of
democracy in Britain because of the over-centralisation of power in
the hands of Blair and the attack on civil liberties.
