<h1>The need to build a new left alternative &#8211; Now!</h1>

<h3>Pete McLaren, national secretary of the Socialist Alliance and press officer of the Campaign for a New Workers Party (CNWP), has written this contribution to <span class="name">The Socialist</span> in response to the article by general secretary of the PCS trade union, Mark Serwotka, in issue 519. Below Pete&#8217;s contribution is a response from Socialist Party councillor Dave Nellist, the national CNWP chair person.</h3>

<p>Mark Serwotka raised the vitally important question for all socialists in his interesting article headed &#8216;How can an alternative to the main parties be developed?&#8217;. He ably explained why we need it. New Labour must now be seen as a Tory party, nothing less. So Mark comes to the conclusion that many of us made some time ago &#8211; we need a new left party.</p>

<p>What impresses me is that Mark clearly sees that industrial struggle alone will not be enough, important as trade union support for a new initiative will be. I also think his call to campaign for proportional representation is crucial for the left to make best use of electoral opportunities, not that electoralism would be the be-all and end-all. Equally significant is his call for left unity, with his assertion: &#8220;Our loyalty must be to our class, not our party card&#8221;. As Mark concluded, what unites us is far greater than what divides us. The old 80/20.</p>

<p>I believe strongly that we should be building a new mass socialist organisation/party &#8211; and quickly. There may not yet be an upturn in working class political activity, but workers are increasingly realising that there is no real difference between the policies of the three main parties. They want an alternative in the here and now. If not, some will turn to the racist and fascist BNP, as has already begun.</p>

<h4>Working to a timetable</h4>

<p>The discussion on how to build that alternative must start now. We need a timetable. It should be in no more than two years &#8211; or by the next general election. That would force us to focus. At the moment the CNWP is a <span class="em">campaign</span> for a new party. I am proud to be the CNWP press officer, and the Socialist Alliance, of which I am national secretary, has played a positive role in the CNWP&#8217;s development. But, after two years, it remains very much a campaign, albeit the most likely one to succeed. </p>

<p>A campaign is pursued to achieve a purpose. What is the CNWP&#8217;s purpose? It is to form a new workers&#8217; party. After two years of pursuing that goal, we need to take stock. How close are we to it? If we do not intend to have that new party in place by the next general election, for example, then what is our goal? If it is the same goal we set ourselves in March 2006, then why have our actions not been effective?</p>

<h4>Moving CNWP forward</h4>

<p>The Socialist Alliance has put forward a number of suggestions which could have moved the CNWP towards at least a pre-party formation or a pro-party alliance. We have suggested that the 3,000 CNWP supporters are encouraged to become individual members of the campaign. We called on the CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and automatic representation from all supportive political organisations irrespective of size, and representation for independents. We asked for CNWP working groups to develop the agreed policy points in the CNWP Charter. We suggested a discussion e-list to encourage dialogue between supporters. All of these, so far rejected by the Socialist Party majority, would keep the campaign going whilst starting to prepare for a more structured organisation &#8211; as agreed at the CNWP launch conference.</p>

<p>We need a party/organisation that is open, inclusive of both individuals and socialist/green socialist groups, pluralistic, democratic and non-sectarian in every sense of the word. It should be formed both by campaigning amongst the working class, as the CNWP quite rightly is doing, but also by inviting all the left to join. Yes, that includes the Socialist Workers&#8217; Party (SWP).</p>

<h4>Socialist unity</h4>

<p>How you get that unity is not easy. The Socialist Alliance moved at the last CNWP steering committee for discussions to commence about how best to approach all socialist unity projects and other progressive red/green groups and individuals &#8211; with a view to inviting them to a conference in 2008 to <span class="strong">discuss ways of uniting the left</span> &#8211; not to form the new party. That was also rejected.</p>

<p>Some of us have been striving for socialist unity for over 15 years. Why has it not happened? We need to identify the hurdles. The main one is the sectarianism of the left. Each left group/unity project thinks it has the answers and seeks to build its own organisation first and foremost. We must learn tolerance and respect for each other, and acknowledge that none of us has all the answers. Those of us involved in the original SA, or, indeed, within Respect, will be only too aware of the SWP&#8217;s control freakery. We will need structures in place that prevent a repeat. But we need to include the SWP, just as we should welcome and include all progressive socialist and green socialist forces.</p>

<p>Mark Serwotka was so right when he mentioned the idiocy of there being three different socialist unity projects meeting on the same Saturday in different venues. By the following weekend, a further four had met nationally but separately &#8211; Respect Renewal, the SA, TUSP and the AGS. This division of the left into at least seven distinct blocks has got to be overcome. As a start, whilst we continue to develop the CNWP, we should also organise a delegate conference to discuss, at the very least, ways of uniting the left, and explore how we could unite better. The SA will be pursuing this goal in the months ahead.</p>
